business,"novartis hits acquisition trail swiss drugmaker novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ( 7.4bn; 3.9bn) of purchases to make its sandoz unit the world's biggest generic drug producer. novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of germany's hexal. it also acquired 67.7 of hexal's us affiliate eon labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for 31 each. novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about 200m a year following the acquisitions. novartis' shares rose 1 to 57.85 swiss francs in early trading. the deal will see novartis' sandoz business overtake israel's teva pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics. based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than 5bn, the company estimated. novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts. ""the strong growth outlook for sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,"" the firm said in a statement. generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. producers such as sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost. there are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. however, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal.

business,"saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden. the car, unveiled at the geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. it will not be sold in the us, said gm europe president carl-peter forster. as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers, the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine. gm's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory's closure. the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations. but the group's new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's opel workers in ruesselsheim, germany. they may now have to face a larger proportion of gm's cuts. neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market. for years, saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw, mercedes and jaguar. the segment's leaders do not agree. gm's plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers. in the us, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe. other luxury car makers, most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. there, german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market. bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m ( 104m; 151m euros) from 500m the previous year. beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations, gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs, opels - badged as vauxhalls in the uk - and now cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar, which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers. but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news. the current trend towards us production was ""stupid"", he said. in a separate announcement, gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models. it is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us. gm said it wanted to change ""customers' perceptions"" about opel and vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.","another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car.as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers, the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine.neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market.""we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news.general motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden.the car, unveiled at the geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.other luxury car makers, most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe.it will not be sold in the us, said gm europe president carl-peter forster.bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.gm's plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers.doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar, which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers.it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us.",positive,0.9964966177940369

""apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice,"" the lawsuit states. the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to ernest gellhorn, an anti-trust law professor at george mason university.

""by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. in a speech in london on monday, mr howard said: ""it's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."" he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that ""firm but fair"" immigration controls were essential for good community relations. - withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for ""national security"" - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk. mr howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a ""substantial reduction"" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current ""unfair and inhumane"" system. ""we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum,"" mr howard said. ""by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling."" but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy, which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans ""dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible"". lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down 40 and economic migration down about 10 . he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion ""disgraceful"".","as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, michael howard has said.""we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum,"" mr howard said.and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy, which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.in a speech in london on monday, mr howard said: ""it's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.""the plans would help achieve a ""substantial reduction"" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure.mr howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough.he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current ""unfair and inhumane"" system.liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.but he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.- withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for ""national security"" - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps.",positive,0.9645196795463562

politics,"campaign 'cold calls' questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing ""cold calls"". the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications. the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. but that did not happen for ""voter identification"" calls. ""when we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,"" he said.

""if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned,"" said mr jones. ""if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations.

tech,"mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype? let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the mac mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired apple design. there is more to be said on the computer's size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer. inside that small box there is a g4 processor, a cd dvd player, a hard drive, some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. a dvd burner, wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. and if you do not have a monitor, keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also. it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under 400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - apple software. the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x, the operating system, as well as ilife 05, a suite of software which includes itunes, web browser safari, iphoto, garage band and idvd. i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x. of course, users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs. for people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer. ""it's a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses,"" said mark sparrow, technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine. he added: ""in essence, it's a laptop in a biscuit tin, minus the screen and the keyboard. ""the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick."" the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs. one user has already created a ""dock"" to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car. the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes, music, films and photos - partly due to its small, living room friendly design. but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at 80gb for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre. while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content. a media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small. most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not. but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses. so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing? graham barlow, editor of mac format, understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint. ""it's just a mac, but we should be very excited - it's revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs), looks (looks better than pcs), and the fact that it's the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market."" the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland, bulky boxes. there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards. but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft's media center software. but for the value the mac mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, apple is to be congratulated. let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.","another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse.so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing?but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses.there is more to be said on the computer's size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer.the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x, the operating system, as well as ilife 05, a suite of software which includes itunes, web browser safari, iphoto, garage band and idvd.the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland, bulky boxes.one user has already created a ""dock"" to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car.for people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not.let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.""it's just a mac, but we should be very excited - it's revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs), looks (looks better than pcs), and the fact that it's the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market.""let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the mac mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired apple design.but for the value the mac mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, apple is to be congratulated.a media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small.",neutral,0.8690937161445618
politics,"'hitler' row over welsh arts cash an artist critical of welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in russia and germany. shani rhys james is worried that the arts council of wales may be taken over by the welsh assembly government. culture minister alun pugh said it would be ""crass and ignorant"" to liken a quango review to hitler's germany. but ms james emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. the future of the arts council of wales has been in question since it was announced that most welsh quangos would eventually be abolished. it was announced last july that three welsh quangos, education and training body elwa, the wales tourist board and the welsh development agency, would be brought under assembly government control. the arts council of wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella. but ms james, who won the 30,000 jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. ms james told bbc radio wales: ""it's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways. ""free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. you need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way."" but she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate. she told good morning wales: ""just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said i likened the government to bolshevik russia or hitler's germany, the actual quote i gave was: 'it is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'. ""as we know from past european history, i.e. russia and germany in the early 20th century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'. ""artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.'"" she said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in wales. she added: ""it would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. it would set the arts scene back 60 years, because i really don't think the government has the expertise.

""you can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,"" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as grand theft auto: san andreas and halo 2. jan bolz, ea's vice president of sales and marketing in europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. he said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality tv show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game the sims. ""one idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show',"" said mr bolz. he also said ea was planning an international awards show ""similar to the oscars and the grammys"" which would combine video games, music and movies. mr bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities.

""we want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland. ""we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.

""just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,"" stan lee told the bbc. the incredible hulk, the mighty thor, iron man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. radically, lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. jack kirby, frank miller, john romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. daredevil was blind, black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity. lee's influence remains. some years ago the marvel hero, northstar, came out of the closet. in its heyday, marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. until he retired from editing in 1971, stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel's covers. in 1999, his stan lee media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. in 2001 though, he started a new company entitled pow! (purveyors of wonder) entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. his latest project is a superhero based on a real person - jay j armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. but his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with x-men, the hulk and daredevil have all been turned into hollywood action movies in the last five years. but spider-man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost 1.6bn ( 857m) in ticket sales around the world - before dvd and merchandise sales are counted. it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.","by the time he was 40, lee had decided he was too old for the comic game.without immediately knowing it, stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled.spider-man was born.stan lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spider-man movies.so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline.and the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.in its heyday, marvel was selling 50 million copies a year.at last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero.""just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,"" stan lee told the bbc.daredevil was blind, black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity.it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.he was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18.radically, lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work.he assumed the ""dumb name"", stan lee, now legally adopted.lee's answer, in 1961, was the fantastic four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays.until he retired from editing in 1971, stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel's covers.he was to become an icon of modern popular culture.lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne.",positive,0.9959653615951538

""we're currently taking a legal opinion on this. we'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court,"" ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"". the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added. over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. and last november samuel amoah, a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk, was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office, has been key in many prosecutions. registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. ""they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,"" mr rimmer said. mr rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. ""it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry, for example, in holland, germany or france. ""i think it's a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,"" mr rimmer said.","new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force.the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year.""these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were ""not proportionate"" and ""discriminatory"".but from tuesday all non-eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'.mr rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"".the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office, has been key in many prosecutions.we'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court,"" ms beynon said.from tuesday, most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry.the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights.",neutral,0.9883522391319275
politics,"terror powers expose 'tyranny' the lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial. lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move. there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain. or so says home secretary charles clarke. my reaction? so what? it is not that i am cynical or just do not care. i care about this country very much. but in the 66 years that i have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us. my point is, the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. but that is what the blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny. i was born on 25 august, 1938. the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler. a week after my first birthday, the threat had become reality. we were at war. my father wore a uniform for five years. after 1945 we yearned for peace at last. but in 1946 winston churchill told us - from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe. behind the iron curtain, another genocidal psychopath, another threat. josef stalin triggered the cold war, with the berlin blockade in 1948. my whole generation was blighted by it. we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust, the nuclear wind, the nuclear winter. we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing. we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals. we took silly precautions. some fought it; some marched futilely against it. some pretended it was not there. the cold war lasted 43 years, but we remained a parliamentary democracy. by the early seventies it was terrorism as well. al fatah, black september, red brigades, but most of all for us the ira and the inla. thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny. that was why the tyrants lost. civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes , and one judge, no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised. informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle. but habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal was not abolished. now the threat is islamic fundamentalism. its leaders want to destroy our society; so did the ira. it is based and funded abroad; so was the ira. it has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the ira. it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the ira. the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the ira. but we did. and without becoming a tyranny. now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. to be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny. but a tyranny is based on the citizen's terror. this is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired. an interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but i suggest we move one step further. our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and 'hunting' in the 'shadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart. rather than focusing upon effect, we should consider the cause, because terrorism does not begin with bombs. why not try a foreign policy of compassion, it can only enhance our democracy, and share our freedom. i agree with frederick forsyth. we really can't deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state. what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians. if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any. our security services, behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty, rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it, while the real villain gets away. remember there were no wmd in iraq. just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist. in this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like mr. forsyth speak out. yes, there has been oppression by the british government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal, for example).this country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?). when id cards become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act, and will be readily available to people like gchq, with no control by the person whose id is being checked. the threat now is new. you cannot compare the threats of past years with now. forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001. the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology. a kilo of semtex will flatten a building, a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. i agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too. the problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no. however, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far. as somebody of chinese origin, i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. whilst life wasn't perfect, we could make better for ourselves. now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. we have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions. we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad. mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions. let's hope the bbc doesn't get gagged for letting people express their views. the people have the right to know and the bbc's role is to inform, educate and entertain... i agree. terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties. in the end, the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. the terrorists have already won. i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth. yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate. the idea that the ""new terrorism"" demands new powers is erroneous. the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant. ricin, for example, is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear. if the government has its way with id cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not. we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others. i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. that goes right back to magna carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they ""knew best"". when you look at today's britain, you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date. frederick forsyth puts it beautifully. the government is seeking to introduce a police state. the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years. we are sleep-walking into this. wake up! an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence. 2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it. because these terrorists are potentially so deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses. it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked. we won't have much of a society left to debate ! he's correct in most of what he says. mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira. administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now. surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?)they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack. i don't usually have much time for mr forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on. there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u.k. but it is very doubtful whether al-qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. the rise of surveillance cameras, id cards, the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times, this is the stuff of nightmares. add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary, and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit. where will this end. as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs. mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise. thank you. mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides. he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now. experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times. for very little return and maximum alienation. these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same. forsyth is wrong. the nature of the current threat is new. it is no longer to our armed forces, as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was. it is to you and i. the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. the best comparison is therefore the blitz, 1941. at this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public. we must not forget we are at war. i'd say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a ""when"" not an ""if"" probability. i'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the uk. people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair. i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government. the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government. i believe what this government is doing, is, at the very least, highly questionable and at worst, sinister. at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly? our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. it should be of great concern to everyone. i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him. i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one. i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism. how true. there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the 30's. i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within. mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler, stalin, and the ira all failed. as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not. that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. but to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently. let us hope not. frederic forsythe's comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole, and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as mr. forsythe's opening comments suggest. i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson. ""a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither."" the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task, and have made a policy to deal with it. it's all very well criticising that policy, but if mr forsythe can't draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative, i say 'so what?' to his opinions. frederick forsyth's rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable. he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour. this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance. i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth, but in this instance i think he is correct. the rule of law must prevail, civil liberties are worth defending. if the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next? i agree absolutely. by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. our democratic system is not perfect, but as churchill points out it is ""better than all the others that have been tried"". terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom. i do not usually agree with mr. forsyth, but he is spot on here. the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose. totalitarianism always requires an outside threat, justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want. the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation. although, in principle i agree with him, frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people. the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement. yes, i agree with mr. forsyth's views. i do not believe the government's plans are justified. there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president's interpretation of democracy and freedom. he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii, the wars to ""liberate"" iraq, afghanistan with syria and iran to come. we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations. mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests. sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who, mr. forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little austrian.' thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour's propositions. like new labour, he called himself a libertarian. like new labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests. but as forsythe criticises this government, hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. simply put, he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign, as protection against his fellow, barbaric, man. hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity, and rightly so. i hope new labour suffers the same treatment. i agree with mr forsyth's views. the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy. they must not be allowed to get away with it. of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. has he forgotten about shoot to kill, torture, internment without trial, collusion with loyalist death squads etc? my background is somewhat similar to freddie's so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms. whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive, it is, unfortunately, also the first step towards totalitarianism. who is to decide whom is a suspect? why should we believe them? who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years? what is to stop false denunciations? what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers? who will support their families? will their children still go to school? it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany, stalin's russia, ceausescu's romania - the list goes on. it looks as if a new dark age is coming. i see that opinion on mr forsyth's remarks are divided. the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of. but history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power. after all, today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! and that day, you'll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces, you have to be shown to be deserving of it. if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting. i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth, but i'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. we, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods. i grieve for the future of my children, it's no wonder they're adamant they don't ever want any of their own. this government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. this puts it on a par with the government of burma. like many of your respondents, i wouldn't usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share, but in the instance of opposing charles clark's proposals for house arrest, i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth. just look at the facts - our government (along with the us) invaded another sovereign country (iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear. the facts turned out to be very different. if individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. we become animals too. i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order. mr forsyth links ""islamic fundamentalism"" to the new ""threat"". however it appears that he has misunderstood the term ""islamic fundamentalism"". it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the qur'aan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist. this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form, nor does she he kill innocent women, men and children. this person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her his actions by being good to others. the people who mr forsyth labels the new ""threat"" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam. they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions. on top of that, they claim to be following islam in its true form! i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british. being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on. during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf, to the right of where i write this, and also to the left in the city of london. notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of 10 downing street, there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq. even when england was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards, which winston churchill decided had to go since, he said, the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally i can still remember my old id card number). hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered. what can i add to mr. forsyth's eloquently put arguments... except applause! well done that man for standing up and being counted in the ""war against tyranny"".","mr forsyth links ""islamic fundamentalism"" to the new ""threat"".the people who mr forsyth labels the new ""threat"" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam.mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler, stalin, and the ira all failed.the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.like many of your respondents, i wouldn't usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share, but in the instance of opposing charles clark's proposals for house arrest, i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth.the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests.i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who, mr. forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little austrian.'i do not usually agree with mr. forsyth, but he is spot on here.an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.the threat now is new.i agree with frederick forsyth.as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said -

in northern ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.the nature of the current threat is new.but in the 66 years that i have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us.yes, i agree with mr. forsyth's views.but to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.)they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked.forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001.but that is what the blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny.i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth, but i'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him.these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same.forsyth is wrong.if the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort.the government is seeking to introduce a police state.that goes right back to magna carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they ""knew best"".mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides.like new labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.just look at the facts - our government (along with the us) invaded another sovereign country (iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence.frederick forsyth puts it beautifully.terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler.mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy.i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one.but history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.now the threat is islamic fundamentalism.i don't usually have much time for mr forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.the problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.at this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.because these terrorists are potentially so deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.the idea that the ""new terrorism"" demands new powers is erroneous.you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.however, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far.it is based and funded abroad; so was the ira.this puts it on a par with the government of burma.thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.the terrorists have already won.like new labour, he called himself a libertarian.(apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal, for example).this country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?and without becoming a tyranny.when you look at today's britain, you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.but as forsythe criticises this government, hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.it has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the ira.just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.you cannot compare the threats of past years with now.our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.i agree.if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.",neutral,0.9997441172599792

""my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,"" he said. ""and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative."" in the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100 debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, george osborne, said: ""this was more talk from gordon brown.

sport,"time to get tough on friendlies? for an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. i would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. the debate will rage on, and i'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter, who is a canny manager. the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. it's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england's game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson's side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played. the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.","some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.i would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so.it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured.the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil.often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.it is the sort of move you would expect from walter, who is a canny manager.john toshack has his first game in charge of wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary.one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith.the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts.the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce.",neutral,0.5047423243522644

business,"india seeks to boost construction india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector. kamal nath, commerce and industry minister, announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting. analysts say improving india's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. the indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some indian firms. a spokesman for dlf builders, dr vancheshwar, told the bbc this will mean ""better offerings"" for consumers as well as builders. he said the firm will benefit from world class ""strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice."" the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board, which can be bureaucratic. the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries. mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. ""foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,"" said mr nath, without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. anshuman magazine, managing director, of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was ""a big positive step."" however, chittabrata majumdar, general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu), said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india's own ""self reliance"". he said, ""no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone."" mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.","he said, ""no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.""india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector.the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments.mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.analysts say improving india's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too.previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market.",positive,0.9996852874755859

tech,"learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life, at least for some, argues technology analyst bill thompson. one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work. i can sit in a caf 233; or a library, with or without a wi-fi connection, and research and write articles. if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform. and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne, a children's writer, at her house in cambridge, sharing her wireless network. but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection. we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power, and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again. she called her service provider, and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem. this did not seem too bad, but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday. with no modem installed in her computer, she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter's laptop, so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection. as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up. she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively. but the impact spread into her personal life too. she did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas. she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website. and she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type ""fossils norfolk"" into google. of course, she readily admits, she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper, listened to the radio or found a book on fossils. but she did not, because having fast, always on, and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life, and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things. she may be unusual, but i do not think anne is alone. according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004, and numbers are climbing fast. there will certainly be five million by the end of the year. dial-up users are switching to broadband. my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections, and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason. it is part of the process of adaptation, and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere. people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it, and show off the cool stuff they can do. they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity. of course, broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world. in south korea, japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits, or millions of bits, a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with. but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband, and when it comes to checking websites for film times, looking at weather forecasts, or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives, even uk speeds are sufficient. it may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads, but it will do for now. and it is certainly better than slow access or no access. just ask anne. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme

politics,"report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects. a national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by 1.7bn in the past year. it says there is ""little evidence"" the mod's performance had improved, despite the introduction of a ""smart acquisition"" policy six years ago. a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned. the nao's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach 50bn - 14 higher than originally planned. the total delays amounted to 62 months, with average individual delays rising by three months. sir john bourn, head of the nao, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied. ""many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase,"" the report says. the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older ""legacy projects"", such as the eurofighter. a senior defence official, speaking to the bbc's defence correspondent paul adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. this year's overspend was significantly less than last year's 3.1bn total, and the defence procurement agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving. lord bach, minister for defence procurement, said he was ""obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown"", but insisted that the defence procurement agency had ""undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects"". the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises. turning around the defence procurement agency ""was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed"", he said. our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the joint strike fighter, the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. but he added some projects, such as the c-17 heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe (siff), were showing good performances.","lord bach, minister for defence procurement, said he was ""obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown"", but insisted that the defence procurement agency had ""undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects"".a senior defence official, speaking to the bbc's defence correspondent paul adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle.this year's overspend was significantly less than last year's 3.1bn total, and the defence procurement agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects.our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the joint strike fighter, the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay.the nao's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach 50bn - 14 higher than originally planned.a national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by 1.7bn in the past year.",positive,0.9992666840553284

""virtual weight"" measurements are based on research by california institute of technology professor roy williams. he calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s. he worked out that one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes) was the equivalent of a pick-up truck filled with paper. the amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly a sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things. if digital hoarding habits continue on this scale, people could be carrying around a ""digitally obese"" 20 gigabytes by next year.

""we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,"" andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. ""now officials are doing it."" within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities. mr gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov's comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil.

tech,"looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts gartner. more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales. ""all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe,"" mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. ""japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years' time. ""they already have tv, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones."" but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. ""at the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical."" nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. this was not a ""women's thing"", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. ""western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,"" said ms milanesi. ""people are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. ""this year music will have a part to play in this."" the market for full-track music downloads was worth just 20 million ( 10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth 1.8 billion ( 9.4 million) by 2009, according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone, the w800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. in july last year, motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola's standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.","apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola's standard music application for its music phones.third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts.in july last year, motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones.but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod.sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone, the w800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera.this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner.it was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner.but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology.nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own.ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives.more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services.",positive,0.9995593428611755
politics,"ukip's secret weapon? by any measure, new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner. this is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris, it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics. so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject, morris appears almost evangelical. ""i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was ukip leader roger knapman. ""i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there"". but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him? many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics. ""i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism"". a great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september. ""it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better, who don't believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined. ""that's international bankers, the world trade organisation, the international monetary fund, the world bank and, primarily, the european union"". so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. ""the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do). ""it's like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: 'before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody'"". possibly a very american analogy, but another great soundbite. ""the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it"". so is ukip's job to destroy the tories, as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared? ""no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move. ""but it's not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"". and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites. ""robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one"". so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough? ""look, we are not going to be forming the next government,"" he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll. ""the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it"". ""anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment. ""labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"". that might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task, surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking. ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all, he has a reputation to sustain.","so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus.the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.""anything can happen in the next general election.so what is the big plan for the general election.but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking.as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain.so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"".and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.""i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was ukip leader roger knapman.and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.on this subject, morris appears almost evangelical.""the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries).but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him?neither does ukip have to fight every seat.but morris is no ideologue.many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics.""labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"".he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from mexico to uruguay.",neutral,0.9988601207733154

tech,"cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts. the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73 of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus. in its end-of-year report, messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003, messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data. older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. ""e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,"" said mark sunner, chief technology officer at messagelabs. ""in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,"" he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. ""already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,"" he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40 of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk.","but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month.mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.other statistics show that in 2004 73 of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months.older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened.in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages.although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals.in its end-of-year report, messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals.",positive,0.9995928406715393

politics,"research fears over kelly's views scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary ruth kelly's religious views could hamper vital scientific research. ms kelly, who is catholic, is reported to be ""pro-life"" and has opposed embryo research. medical research council professor nancy rothwell said ms kelly's views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists. the department for education and skills would not comment on the concerns. a spokeswoman said: ""it is not news that ms kelly is a catholic but we are not going into any details on this."" but she added that claims ms kelly was in charge of a 1bn university research budget were not true. it was down to the higher education funding council and the research councils to decide on universities' research allocations. british law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells, master cells that can develop into all the body's tissue types. this cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments. however, it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos. professor rothwell, who is also vice-president of research at manchester university, told the times higher education supplement it would worry her ""a great deal"" if ministers were anti-stem cell. she said: ""the views of ministers in the dfes do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists. ""you can't have a higher education policy that is at odds with the government's science policy."" head of developmental genetics at the national institute of medical research, professor robin lovell-badge, said he had witnessed the confused situation in the us where many religious groups opposed the practice. he said: ""if someone as senior as ruth kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country. it is very worrying."" but fertility expert lord winston said he thought it was ""rather good"" ministers held ethical views. concerns have also been raised by ""pro-choice"" organisations that ms kelly's views might affect sex education policy in schools. family planning association chief executive, anne weyman, said teaching pupils about contraception and abortion were key. ""young people must be informed about all the issues within sexual health, which include contraception and abortion.

business,"turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis, turkey has dressed its economy to impress. as part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 december, when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks - turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. the economy is growing fast, they insist. education levels among its young and large population are rising. unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. inflation is under control. a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to 21bn ( 10.8bn) in three years. moreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract 15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund (imf) is pretty much in the can. and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent. the point of all this has been to convince europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu, allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits. ""the cake will be bigger for everybody,"" said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month. ""turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget."" if admitted into the eu, turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ( 8bn; 6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's state planning organisation. as turkey's gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6 per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in ""old europe"" once its population comes of age. by 2014, one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. ""a literate and qualified turkish population,"" insisted mr sener, ""will make a positive impact on the eu."" this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers' wallets. however, turkey's assertions are confirmed by brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector, which currently employs one in three turks, would employ just one in five by 2020. such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned. some fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for europe at large, the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. more recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced, with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a ""river of islam"", an ""oriental"" culture and a threat to europe's ""cultural richness"". of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country's muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government's human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand. critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134 rise in the country's current account deficit to 10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year. the country's massive debt - which includes 23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu. ""in the new member states of the european union, gross public debt is typically about 40 of gross domestic product,"" says reza moghadam, assistant director of the imf's european department. ""at about 80 of gdp, turkey's gross debt is double that figure."" turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession. ""there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,"" says michael deppler, director of the imf's european department. ""its debt is far too high for an emerging economy."" a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.","if admitted into the eu, turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ( 8bn; 6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's state planning organisation.critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134 rise in the country's current account deficit to 10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.as turkey's gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6 per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020.three years after a gruelling economic crisis, turkey has dressed its economy to impress.however, turkey's assertions are confirmed by brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy.a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria.the point of all this has been to convince europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu, allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.""turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget.""the country's massive debt - which includes 23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu.costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros.""at about 80 of gdp, turkey's gross debt is double that figure.""turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession.the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to 21bn ( 10.8bn) in three years.""in the new member states of the european union, gross public debt is typically about 40 of gross domestic product,"" says reza moghadam, assistant director of the imf's european department.such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned.and although the state of turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.",positive,0.9996763467788696

""the second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on. while the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however, mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. ""we put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a tv a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook."" mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.

""we reckon it's going to cost european air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over 1bn a year loaded onto european passengers,"" mr clarke said.

""things will be totally different this time,"" he told bbc sport. ""now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona."" chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from rivaldo (2), luis figo, dani and patrick kluivert. former chelsea captain desailly, who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team, who are top of the premiership. ""mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,"" the 36-year-old said. ""we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. ""it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality."" world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for 4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. ""the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,"" he said. ""everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. ""since that game in 2000, chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season."" desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france, the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan, two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar, alongside the likes of frank lebeouf, josep guardiola, titi camara, gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta.

tech,"file-swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are ""quality copies"". in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called ""trackers"" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to. now the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek's involvement with exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis. users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream. dr johan pouwelse, a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. ""exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said. ""the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. ""the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like kazaa,"" he said. ""there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. ""it's hard to compete with free,"" he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.","sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development.mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems.like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse.""the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said.this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to.""the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like kazaa,"" he said.users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream.""exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said.he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program.one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program.",positive,0.7668672204017639

""at that stage he saw gordon brown and said, 'look you are the next most influential member of the government, i need your help to get through the next year,"" mr peston said.

""what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity.

tech,"mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier, dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26 increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold globally between july and september 2004, a period that, according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is ""seldom strong"". but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so. in fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that 36 of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms), up from 7 in 2003. this is despite the fact that, during the same period, the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face, said shailendra jain, head of mms firm adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets. ""also,"" he said, ""they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it."" research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research, 29 of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only 11 regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said mr jain. ""they ask themselves: 'if i'm streaming video from one handset to another will it work?'"" he said. ""there's a lot of user apprehension about that."" there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud, executive chairman of messaging firm mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. ""the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users. no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped, said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as wap-push, to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india, the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result 40 of the subscribers to the hutch alive, which uses celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator. ""operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers,"" said yaron toren, spokesman for celltick. until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.","getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying.the problem they face, said shailendra jain, head of mms firm adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.andrew bud, executive chairman of messaging firm mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said mr jain.figures gathered by continental research shows that 36 of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms), up from 7 in 2003.until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to.""the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" he said.while not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content.he said.but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic.no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped, said mr bud.",positive,0.9996234178543091

""construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website. some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004, china increased its generating capacity by 12.6 , or 440,700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the 22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant. the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river, which is part of a united nations world heritage site, the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze, mekong and nu (also known as the salween), according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.","the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity.china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the three gorges dam, on environmental grounds.second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the 22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.""construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website.the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year.topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china.the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments.altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted.the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad.",negative,0.9758771657943726

""i think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,"" said analyst jason kenney at ing. the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairn's existing oilfields. the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. its mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date.

""if it's 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there's not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn't open on sunday anyway.

her first global title. just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb, it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games. the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november's new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men's olympic squad after a poor start to the games. it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell, jason gardener, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and, just like holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb's athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003. but it was a different story for britain's defending champion denise lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze. and backley's departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey, who came fourth in athens. the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly, the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games, greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. kenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games, adrian annus (hammer), robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. the fallout from the thg scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in olympic year. britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg. american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco's hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m. and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon, there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.","while holmes left athens as the star of team gb, it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double.kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games.gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and, just like holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004.her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m -

business,"iran budget seeks state sell-offs iran's president, mohammad khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30 but loosen the islamic republic's dependence on oil. the budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 march calls for the sell-off of 20 of the state's corporate holdings. mr khatami's second term as president ends on 1 august, making this his last budget. but opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. elections in may 2004 ousted many of mr khatami's supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. the ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by turkish companies, which hardliners accused of doing business with israel. it came not long after the expediency council - iran's ultimate decision-maker - blessed mr khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of mr khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues. in an address to the majlis, mr khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1 in 2005-6, up from 6.7 in the current year. he said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1,546 trillion rials ( 175.6bn; 93.6bn) from the previous year's 1,070 trillion. within that figure, taxation would rise to 14.3bn, a rise of over 40 from what is expected from the current year. in contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to 14.1bn from 16bn in the year to march 2005.

tech,"text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia. the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of ""who needs what and where"". blogging friends in india took mr senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent. and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use. ""sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,"" he says. ""in every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages."" half a world away, in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago, taran rampersad read morquendi's messages. mr rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said: ""imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. ""he can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field."" he added: ""or, send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places."" mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia. in only 72 hours, he found dan lane, a text message guru living in britain. the pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. ""this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,"" says paul saffo, a director at the california-based institute for the future. ""you may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away,"" he said, ""that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy."" it is still very early days for the project, though. in an e-mail, dan lane calls it ""an early proof of concept."" right now, the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there's still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. ""it's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that,"" says mr rampersad. ""so the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication."" he is optimistic, however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto, courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world, a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.","right now, the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list.so mr senanayake started sending out text messages.last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.""he can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.""in the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages.mr rampersad said: ""imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help.the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation.and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use.blogging friends in india took mr senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders.""sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,"" he says.in only 72 hours, he found dan lane, a text message guru living in britain.you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.""you may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away,"" he said, ""that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy.""mr rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster.",neutral,0.9996156692504883

""i caught 'cozza's' eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,"" healey recalled. healey, twice a heineken cup winner, believes last sunday's match was ""up there"" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. ""it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game,"" he recalled. ""there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. ""after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way."" the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed ""rugby's version of rocky ii"".

tech,"web helps collect aid donations the web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. high-profile web portals such as google, yahoo, ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. so many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee (dec) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. it urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways, meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. the site has so far received almost 8 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour. telco bt stepped in to take over the secure payments on the dec site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. it has also provided space in london's bt tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations. some of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. among the 17 organisations listed are oxfam, medecins sans frontieres (doctors without borders) and network for good. many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations. online retailer amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the american red cross that will be used with relief efforts. auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to, divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. the auction drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras, computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. sadly, the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies.","many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations.many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts.on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made.auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to, divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list.an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee (dec) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website.the site has so far received almost 8 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour.high-profile web portals such as google, yahoo, ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations.anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies.",neutral,0.9948717355728149

""we could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,"" he said. he added: ""it is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor."" but he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. bbc correspondent patrick bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. oxfam senior policy adviser max lawson welcomed the statement and said g7 ministers had ""passed the first hurdle of 2005"". but he added: ""they need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world's poorest.

tech,"halo fans' hope for sequel xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november, with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time? halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic, halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven's ringworld and the film starship troopers, it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using dolby digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics. but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming. produced by bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera, editor of fansite halo.bungie.org, said: ""bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. ""nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be."" he added: ""graphically it was superior to everything else out there. ""it also had a depth to it that made it stand out."" halo was unusually immersive, sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time. the game instantly cultivated an online following, which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel, halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website, which attracts 600,000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news. when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us, halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. ""halo is the most important launch game for any console ever,"" wrote the influential edge magazine in its review, giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game, it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. ""the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun,"" said errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game. the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. ""it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo,"" said errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game's amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high.

""i am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions,"" jean-michel lemetayer, from the fnsea agricultural union, told the associated press news agency. in an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. the government will also seek european union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation. production is currently outstripping demand by about 30 . the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. wine makers in france's best-known regions, such as burgundy, have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.","the french government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ( 91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry.the french wine industry, the world's second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines.efforts to promote french wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding.a further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of french producers, in low interest loans.however, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for.the government will also seek european union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation.wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough.",positive,0.9948416352272034

""it is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen,"" he said. on tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually, he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes, prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been. lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news: ""we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.

""the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show,"" said max houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university, us. ""this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof,"" he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science (aaas). the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged dna samples in us labs. yet these constituted just 10 of the total test backlog, said dr houck. forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims. ""what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,"" she explained. ""for example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. but when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult."" dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions. the show's influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. ""prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: 'why wasn't everything tested?' well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,"" dr houck explained. ""defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that's always accurate."" however, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field.

tech,"firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft's internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released. few people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's internet explorer browser. firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft's internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability. internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year, according to websidestory, internet explorer was used by about 95 of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7 and by the end of october stood at 92.9 . the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10 of the windows- using, net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft's program. for instance, firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed. one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox, which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the 50,000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about 250,000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is

politics,"anglers 'could face prosecution' anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of mps has warned. sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. the mps said they were ""concerned"" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, mps said. they called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect ""kept animals"" and ""companion"" animals by setting up a ""duty of care"". in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing ""mutilation"" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest. the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. ""we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government's intention to exempt fishing as an activity."" but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. ""however, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,"" the committee added. the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which ""would be significantly weakened"". mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished. committee chairman michael jack said: ""any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. ""this draft bill is no exception. my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place."" but mr jack said the bill ""very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that ""an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law"" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms.

sport,"athens memories soar above lows well, it's goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens. obviously, there's no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly's success in the 800m. winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of ""should i, shouldn't i?"" thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event? it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story. the victory for the british men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener, darren campbell, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. hicham el guerrouj's olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly's on a global scale. he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and i had finished commentating, i jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my french and his english are not very good. what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day. things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula's olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. purely as a race, paula's victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya's susan chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real ""bouncebackability"". and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. kelly and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level. the only individual men's finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? and that's where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond. i tell you what i really enjoyed this year, benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. to be honest, i'm getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on. having said that, i'm always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.","and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise.it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly's success in the 800m.winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.the victory for the british men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games.that was her heart and not her head reacting.he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles.and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle.it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real ""bouncebackability"".the thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well.the only individual men's finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m.dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb.paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.well, it's goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.and that's where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy.",positive,0.9857357144355774

politics,"blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may. the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term. and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour's stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust. and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message. and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies. during the phoney campaign, labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services. the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour's plans was a cut. and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger ""cuts"". he was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track. a second central argument will be over taxation, with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again. mr brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. as usual, the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on iraq, law and order and education, for example. but, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. and, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.","and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks.during the phoney campaign, labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services.he was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track.then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger ""cuts"".the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted.and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.a second central argument will be over taxation, with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again.the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour's stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust.",neutral,0.9355337023735046

""people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches.

""you need very complicated processes to estimate damages. unlike the hurricanes, you can't just run a model."" he anticipated that his own company's total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes, which the company put at 640m. allianz, a leading german insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be. however, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on its business. zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said. most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka, india, thailand, indonesia, the maldive islands and malaysia,"" said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb. ""us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. it's more likely the bermuda-based reinsurance companies might have some exposure,"" said paul newsome, an insurance analyst at ag edwards co. many of the affected countries, such as indonesia, sri lanka or the maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a us-based insurance expert. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka, india, indonesia and thailand, at about 5bn ( 2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about 10bn in 1998. but the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable. ""we cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,"" said jan egeland, head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. the association of british insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. it said loss of possessions will usually be covered, but the association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.","the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said.munich re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros ( 70m; 136m).swiss re has said total claims are likely to be less than 10bn ( 5.17bn).many of the affected countries, such as indonesia, sri lanka or the maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a us-based insurance expert.allianz, a leading german insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be.it's more likely the bermuda-based reinsurance companies might have some exposure,"" said paul newsome, an insurance analyst at ag edwards co.zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.munich re and swiss re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters.insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka, india, thailand, indonesia, the maldive islands and malaysia,"" said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb.""us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure.early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka, india, indonesia and thailand, at about 5bn ( 2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch.however, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on its business.most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds.",positive,0.988652765750885
tech,"parents face video game lessons ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry. the issue was discussed at a meeting between uk government officials, industry representatives and the british board of film classification. it follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. in 2003, britons spent 1,152m on games, more than ever before. and this christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles. violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother, giselle, said her son's killer, warren leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating stefan's murder dismissed its influence and said manhunt was not part of its legal case. the issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on sunday by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. this was the focus of the talks between government officials, representatives from the games industry and the british board of film classification. ""adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can't and they deserve to be protected,"" said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting. ""industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn't play."" roger bennett, director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association, said: ""a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting.

sport,"italy 17-28 ireland two moments of magic from brian o'driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy. a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer's try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia, but denis hickie's try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes. it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o'gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and, for the first quarter, the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs. when they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, o'driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o'gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead. the only ireland player offering a real threat was o'driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over, with o'gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul. an o'gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o'driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner gordon d'arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout. de marigny; mi bergamasco, canale, masi, nitoglia; orquera, troncon; lo cicero, ongaro, castrogiovanni; dellape, bortolami; persico, ma bergamasco, parisse. perugini, intoppa, del fava, dal maso, griffen, pozzebon, robertson. murphy, horgan, o'driscoll, d'arcy, hickie, o'gara, stringer, corrigan, byrne, hayes, o'kelly, o'connell, s easterby, leamy, foley. sheahan, horan, o'callaghan, miller, g easterby, humphreys, dempsey. p o'brien (new zealand)","an o'gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try.a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer.the only ireland player offering a real threat was o'driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer's try gave ireland a lead they never lost.roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.two moments of magic from brian o'driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o'gara penalty midway through the first half.murphy, horgan, o'driscoll, d'arcy, hickie, o'gara, stringer, corrigan, byrne, hayes, o'kelly, o'connell, s easterby, leamy, foley.a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks.when they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, o'driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy.",positive,0.9968897700309753
business,"yukos owner sues russia for 28bn the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for 28.3bn ( 15.2bn). the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos' main production arm, yugansk, to state-run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. group menatep, the gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51 of yukos, says this was illegal. menatep has already asked rosneft to repay a 900m loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. the russian government's argument for selling yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that yukos owed more than 27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. it accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze yukos accounts and seize yugansk. but critics say the sell-off, and the assault on yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. according to menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. ""we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,"" said tim osborne, a director of group menatep. ""the time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today."" menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from 17.8bn to ""virtually nothing"" since 2003 as a result of the russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97 . according to its paris lawyer, emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60 addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in stockholm or the hague, mr gaillard said. while russia has signed the charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case. but mr gaillard told bbc news that the charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. ""russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,"" he said. yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a us court for bankruptcy protection. it took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of menatep. he has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.","menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from 17.8bn to ""virtually nothing"" since 2003 as a result of the russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97 .group menatep, the gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51 of yukos, says this was illegal.the russian government's argument for selling yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that yukos owed more than 27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for 28.3bn ( 15.2bn).while russia has signed the charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case.mr khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of menatep.the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos' main production arm, yugansk, to state-run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill.""we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,"" said tim osborne, a director of group menatep.according to menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments.",negative,0.9965251088142395

""it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, parliament and special advisers?"" he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said: ""this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the state"". mr howard said the plan would also even out the ""great unfairness"" of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70,000 people, mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66,000, in wales just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was ""consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom"" if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.

politics,"'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. if there was to be a cap, it should be 10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons, european parliament, scottish parliament, welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: ""there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.

""respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,"" said einar bjorgo from unosat, the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium. the group uses satellites from nasa, the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation. the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. from there, the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. ""you have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,"" said stefan voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the german aerospace centre. this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about 12 hours. ""our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,"" said mr voigt. respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. but the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. ""a map is a working document,"" explains herbert hansen of respond's belgian partner keyobs.

business,"yukos unit fetches 9bn at auction a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow. baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy yuganskneftegas. baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ( 9.37bn: 4.8bn) for yugansk - nowhere near the 27bn russia says yukos owes in taxes. yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law, and said baikal had bought itself trouble. ""the company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious 9bn headache,"" said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin. he said the company would continue to make ""every lawful move"" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in yukos from ""this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property"". meanwhile, tim osborne, head of yukos main shareholders' group menatep, said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside russia, against the auction winners. reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly 1.7bn from a sberbank (savings bank) account to the russian federal property fund, for yugansk. the sale came despite a restraining order issued by a us court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for chapter 11 protection. yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. there were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite. but just two companies turned up for the auction, gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group, named after a large freshwater lake in siberia. and, according to tass news agency, gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles. mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom. kaha kiknavelidze, analyst at troika dialog, said: ""i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago. so the main question was how to structure this transaction. ""i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner. ""i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and gazprom is then recognised as the winner. this would give gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. ""another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price."" however, gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way. and paul collison, chief analyst at brunswick ubs, said: ""i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests. ""yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government. there is still potential for surprises."" yugansk is at the heart of yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than 27bn in taxes and fines. yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in us courts. the us bankruptcy court's initial order on thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to yukos filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on saturday. the protection, if recognised by the russian authorities, would have allowed yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the bbc's sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable. hours before the auction lawyers for menatep, a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.","yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law, and said baikal had bought itself trouble.a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow.meanwhile, tim osborne, head of yukos main shareholders' group menatep, said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside russia, against the auction winners.hours before the auction lawyers for menatep, a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries.""the company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious 9bn headache,"" said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin.however, gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way.yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes.""i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner.yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, mikhail khodorkovsky.baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ( 9.37bn: 4.8bn) for yugansk - nowhere near the 27bn russia says yukos owes in taxes.but just two companies turned up for the auction, gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group, named after a large freshwater lake in siberia.reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly 1.7bn from a sberbank (savings bank) account to the russian federal property fund, for yugansk.and, according to tass news agency, gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.the protection, if recognised by the russian authorities, would have allowed yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets.",negative,0.9587358832359314

""we have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,"" producer gil cates told reporters. however, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on us tv. he also played down fears that rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. the 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. ""chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,"" cates said.

tech,"internet boom for gift shopping cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for christmas shoppers. forecasts predict that british people will spend 4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64 on 2003. surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in high street stores. almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers. about 85 of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group. on average each shopper will spend 220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping. almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29 from german shoppers and only 4 from italian gift buyers. james roper, director of the imrg, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as lcd television sets and digital cameras. mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas. he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends. much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm saint bernard software. the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops. iggy fanlo, chief revenue officer at shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping. ""when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher,"" he said. higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy. the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. ""the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,"" he said. ""the number one reason now is convenience."" ""very few consumers click on the lowest price,"" he said. ""they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability."" consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for 104.99. in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans.","the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said.""the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,"" he said.mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas.iggy fanlo, chief revenue officer at shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping.on average each shopper will spend 220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping.he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular.about 85 of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group.forecasts predict that british people will spend 4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64 on 2003.surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online.almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers.much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm saint bernard software.almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29 from german shoppers and only 4 from italian gift buyers.a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends.many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country.",positive,0.9996272325515747

tech,"tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems, plasma high-definition tvs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years' time. that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes, like the us's tivo and the uk's sky system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want. essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets, which are big business in japan and the us, but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky . ""what happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the uk,"" adam hume, the bbc broadcast's futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. ""we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,"" said tim hanlon, from brand communications firm starcom mediavest. ""the reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content."" he added: ""the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice."" what this means, said stacey jolna, senior vice president of tv guide tv group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks, in us terms, or channels could take a leaf out of google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, mr hanlon suggested. ""on the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,"" said mr hanlon. ""ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want."" of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces, many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax's 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us's biggest satellite tv companies, directtv, has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo, called tivotogo, which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.","what this means, said stacey jolna, senior vice president of tv guide tv group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers.these set-top boxes, like the us's tivo and the uk's sky system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised tv.with home theatre systems, plasma high-definition tvs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years' time.it means that networks, in us terms, or channels could take a leaf out of google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them, instead of being external boxes.one such example launched at the show is humax's 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder.one of the us's biggest satellite tv companies, directtv, has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels.with the us leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, mr hanlon suggested.one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr).",neutral,0.9981306195259094

politics,"howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future. the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election, where george bush opposed extending it. but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer's, parkinson's and motor neurone disease. ""i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,"" he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue. mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued: ""we mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. ""politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind.

""in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said mr r. sridharan, vice president of networks at tata. ""heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,"" he said. in some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. this has led chennai-based tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata's core network and the premises of customers. the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate. ""it's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,"" he said. in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said mr sridharan.

tech,"poles play with gameboy 'blip-pop' a group of artists in poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on nintendo's handheld gameboy console to a new level. the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed ""blip-pop."" think of it as donkey kong meets norman cook, or maybe tetris takes on kraftwerk. any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. all the sounds are made by six nintendo gameboys, with a mixture of older models and newer advance sp handhelds. the gameboyzz orchestra project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board. jarek kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now. ""i was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine,"" said kujda. he realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. he wondered, if one gameboy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born.

""we prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert."" the group plays maybe four or five shows a year. malgorzata kujda, jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise. ""for example, i make music with more hard beats and noises,"" she said. ""but each of us makes another music, a different sound. and then in the concert we just improvise, and that i think is more fun for us."" the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. some love the group's music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it. in the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. but jarek kujda says they try to be unique. ""we have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like commodore, atari, spectrum,"" he said. ""we want to play only experimental music, not cover songs. we're something like an electronic jam session."" the gameboyzz orchestra project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a cd next year. and they have sponsorship, courtesy of the polish distributor of nintendo products. the members of the gameboyzz orchestra project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. a gameboy advance costs about us 200 in poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most polish gamers, or musicians. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world, a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production","the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed ""blip-pop.""""gameboyzz orchestra project is more of an improvisational project,"" said kudja.malgorzata kujda, jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise.kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born.in the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique.""i was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine,"" said kujda.jarek kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now.""but each of us makes another music, a different sound.he wondered, if one gameboy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together?the members of the gameboyzz orchestra project do not expect serious competition anytime soon.the gameboyzz orchestra project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a cd next year.the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences.",neutral,0.9997745156288147
business,"unilever shake up as profit slips anglo-dutch consumer goods giant unilever is to merge its two management boards after reporting ""unsatisfactory"" earnings for 2004. it blamed the poor results on sluggish decision making, a rise in discounted retailers and a wet european summer. the company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its slimfast range. unilever, which owns brands including dove soap, said annual pre-tax profit fell 36 to 2.9bn euros ( 1.99bn). shares fell 1 to 510.75 pence in london, and dropped by 1.2 to 50.50 euros in amsterdam. under the restructuring plans, patrick cescau, the uk-based co-chairman, will become group chief executive. dutch co-chairman antony burgmans will take on the role of non-executive chairman. ""we have recognised the need for greater clarity of leadership and we are moving to a simpler leadership structure that will provide a sharper operational focus,"" mr burgmans said.

""the best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification,"" said arjan sweere, an analyst at petercam. the company said the organizational changes would speed decision making, and it also may make further changes. the company said its main focus will be on improving profits, and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands. ""while it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share,"" said mr cescau. ""we let a range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment.""

business,"market unfazed by aurora setback as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner, p o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival's share price, from 35 to 36.20. other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 gmt carnival's shares in london were down a single penny, or 0.03 , at 32.26. why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? ""the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says deutsche bank's simon champion. ""it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events."" despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. ""carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" mr champion. similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk, both for carnival and its main competitor, royal caribbean. ""while not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,"" wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday. ""moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises."" after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash. assuming that citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in carnival's favour. in the wake of p o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, ""slowing supply growth"" is a certainty, said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.","despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003.and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.and its owner, p o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco.in the wake of p o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly.""the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says deutsche bank's simon champion.""carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" mr champion.in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited.",negative,0.9983348250389099

""it's a horrendous effort in the first year,"" he admitted. microsoft had delivered development kits to ea, said mr armes, but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits. although the details may not be nailed down, mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. ""the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood than xbox 2 ,"" he said. ""microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost, while sony has more experience in hardware. i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost."" what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. while short on detail, he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer ""great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people, more communications, more media, more connectivity"". sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games. until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do, developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower. gary dunn, development director at codemasters, said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles. ""we are working on new libraries of effects. a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming, such as pixel shaders and normal mapping."" mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles. ""we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game."" in the first year at least, developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines. graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected. simon gardner, president of climax's action studio, said: ""it's definitely an exciting time. we want to give more freedom to the player. we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play. ""the environments will be much more believable and dramatic, growing and changing as you play. ""there will be a breadth of effects, more involving worlds to play in. ""it's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush. we're being given more tools. ""for the average consumer, we can get things of a more filmic quality."" gerhard florin, head of ea in europe, said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games. many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely. ""ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies,"" said mr florin. he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles. ""a gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros. when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go.

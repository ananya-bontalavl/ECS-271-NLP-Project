politics,"'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. if there was to be a cap, it should be 10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons, european parliament, scottish parliament, welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: ""there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.","it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200.there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m.the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions.in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it.the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections."

business,"uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez's agrarian reform programme. officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure. the firm, whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm. officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. ""the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,"" state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters. ""as a consequence the government has taken action."" controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century. critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added: ""agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land."" the company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the venezuelan market. last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had ""nothing to fear"". under president chavez, the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.","the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities.officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers.venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez's agrarian reform programme.last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000.the firm, whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law.under president chavez, the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy.the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had ""nothing to fear"".the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure."

politics,"research fears over kelly's views scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary ruth kelly's religious views could hamper vital scientific research. ms kelly, who is catholic, is reported to be ""pro-life"" and has opposed embryo research. medical research council professor nancy rothwell said ms kelly's views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists. the department for education and skills would not comment on the concerns. a spokeswoman said: ""it is not news that ms kelly is a catholic but we are not going into any details on this."" but she added that claims ms kelly was in charge of a 1bn university research budget were not true. it was down to the higher education funding council and the research councils to decide on universities' research allocations. british law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells, master cells that can develop into all the body's tissue types. this cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments. however, it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos. professor rothwell, who is also vice-president of research at manchester university, told the times higher education supplement it would worry her ""a great deal"" if ministers were anti-stem cell. she said: ""the views of ministers in the dfes do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists.

""kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of adam smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared.

""in so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living."" dr greenspan said smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. ""the incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the enlightenment - especially with smith toiling in the environs of kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,"" he said. following his lecture, dr greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the queen at balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the royal society of edinburgh. he later opened an exhibition dedicated to smith in the atrium of fife college of further and higher education. joyce johnston, principal of the college, said: ""it is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist."" dr greenspan - who became chairman of the federal reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in june 2004 - will step down in january next year. he has served under presidents george w bush, bill clinton, george bush, and ronald reagan. he was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to gerald ford.","""kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of adam smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared.us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given a speech at a scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, adam smith.he delivered the 14th adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy, fife.dr greenspan, 79, who has been in the uk to attend the g7 meeting in london, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to smith, whose genius he compared to that of mozart.dr greenspan said smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world.mr brown introduced dr greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the ""the world's greatest economist"".dr greenspan was invited by chancellor gordon brown, whose minister father john used to preach at the st bryce kirk church.the adam smith lecture celebrates the author of 1776's wealth of nations, which became a bible of capitalism."
tech,"uk pioneers digital film network the world's first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next 18 months. the uk film council has awarded a contract worth 11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema (aadc), who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment. high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films. most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. the new network will double the world's total of digital screens. cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server. each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. fiona deans, associate director of aadc, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur. the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. ""people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. ""the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time."" the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films, documentaries and foreign language films. ""access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk,"" said pete buckingham, head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council. ""although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk,"" digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said ms deans. ""it can cost up to 1,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. ""in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. ""distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer."" the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 1080 pixels. a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may. the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. ""some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don't need to be shown twice a day,"" explained ms deans. ""a cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema.

tech,"firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft's internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser, which has just been released. few people get excited when some new software is released, especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's internet explorer browser. firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations, but which had the same core technology, were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft's internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability. internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year, according to websidestory, internet explorer was used by about 95 of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7 and by the end of october stood at 92.9 . the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10 of the windows- using, net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft's program. for instance, firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups, has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed. one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras, or extensions, produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox, which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix, also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the 50,000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10,000 people had signed up and now about 250,000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie's hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera, safari, amaya and even netscape.","microsoft's internet explorer has a serious rival in

sport,"ireland 17-12 south africa ronan o'gara scored all ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road. o'gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o'gara penalties extended ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans, ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on, denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss. ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland's first points - o'gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o'gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score, the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however, the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland's lead to 5-3. ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure, the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o'gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o'gara penalty. however, montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland's lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o'gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty. in the 61st minute, hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however, a late tackle on brian o'driscoll enabled o'gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland's lead to 17-6. however, two montgomery penalties had ireland's lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory. g dempsey;

sport,"britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals. kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope, paula radcliffe, dropped out of the marathon and then the 10,000m. britain's men's 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style, falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb, it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games. the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november's new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men's olympic squad after a poor start to the games. it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell, jason gardener, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and, just like holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb's athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003. but it was a different story for britain's defending champion denise lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze. and backley's departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey, who came fourth in athens. the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly, the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games, greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. kenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games, adrian annus (hammer), robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. the fallout from the thg scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in olympic year. britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg. american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco's hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m. and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon, there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.","while holmes left athens as the star of team gb, it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double.kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games.gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and, just like holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004.her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m -

politics,"blair backs 'pre-election budget' tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown's pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in a speech in edinburgh, the prime minister said thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises. he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing. ""that is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" mr brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of labour's programme. in a speech at edinburgh's napier university, he said labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"". ""in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" mr blair said. in his pre-budget report, mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3 and 3.5 for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3 - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson, from the institute for fiscal studies, told bbc news: ""he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be ok. we're not so sure."" david page, of investec securities, said: ""his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of 8bn is way too optimistic.

""managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,"" said jeremy dear, nuj general secretary. nuj official barry fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. ""they have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,"" said mr fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. the two telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists. some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. the telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both the independent and the times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size. the guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental europe. the telegraph group was bought by the barclay twins - frederick and david - last year, having previously been owned by lord conrad black's hollinger international. the brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer littlewoods. telegraph executive murdoch maclennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.

yeah right. i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out. like every track robbie has released as a single, it's a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before. give us a break...!!! best song in 25 years, you must be joking. its good if you like that sort of thing, but really! listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work. had not heard it for a while. i love robs voice, the lyrics and tune. perfection! as usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for ""the greatest"". there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. it's not exactly groundbreaking. presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low... i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!! what about the specials - ghost town, the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone... happy mondays - kinky afro, mcalmont butler - yes, joy division - love will tear us apart... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish. angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. it's musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like mr williams himself. this result isn't very surprising though, the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music! best of the last 25 years? maybe. cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. not much competition in the last 25 years after all. it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years??? there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty. rubbish! who voted it for it to be included in any list? i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years. how depressing and just when we thought manufactured 'pop' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from? while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. then again, well done robbie, good show. you've got to be kidding. angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits. i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years! right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good! i'm happy for robbie himself though! best song in the last 25 years? what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards. so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today, for me it's proof that music and democracy just don't mix. still, at least it wasn't will young... oh it's all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent! i hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with! i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie. i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song. it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush. angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups. robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think. yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning. i've always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as ""classic"" songwriting. it's 'orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer's afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisss angels, best song? you are kidding, right? last five years i might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century. no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from???? compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? i mean, will young? come on. what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close. what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"". why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up. why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! i think not, i didn't realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!! people have such short memories! a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here. the great british public at work again. it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. granted, it's not too bad, either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular ""how soon is now?"") or anything from the stone roses' first album? nope. no, because i'm not female and i'm not 10! ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! the shortlist wasn't great but him winning it is a joke! predictable and laughable. the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years. i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list. have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division? a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will. no doubt about it. there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song. it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds, the beatles and nick drake have done for music today. yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner. i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music. the best song of the past 25 years? really? come on, this is surely a joke? no? i think i need a long lie down... it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it's confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- lt;( no offence robbie, but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music, and a further nail in the coffin! i think robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn't deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey, another one bites the dust!! obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it. if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record. a sad day for music it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. it's a good all-rounder. just like robbie. best song in 25 years? since 1980? i'm confused. ""angels"" isn't a bad song. it's a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it's regressive. bland even. i suppose it's just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become. granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition. the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic! also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him! best song of the last 25 years? what a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside, at least it wasn't bohemian rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful. angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!! don't get me wrong, i'm not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners. it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels, robbie williams may well not be where he is now, and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob. i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'. what about britpop? blur, oasis, suede, pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular? i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters, i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near u2's new record, neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit. no surprise really, it's voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music? personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard! it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come. it's an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn't end up in the hands of will young though. although it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody, nothing compares 2 u, etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent. although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that's all it means!","angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.best song of the last 25 years?best song in the last 25 years?i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years!robbie williams' angels was named the best song of the past 25 years.it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???best song in 25 years?although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years?that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!!the best song of the past 25 years?i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year?if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble.the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!!but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!booo hisss angels, best song?i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!!while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.best song in 25 years, you must be joking.only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years.there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song.i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song.angels is a fantastic song.yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.""angels"" isn't a bad song.personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!best of the last 25 years?i am a huge robbie fan and love that song.think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels.there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.williams' track beat songs by will young, queen, kate bush and joy division in a vote by bbc radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the uk music industry ceremony.but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.a sad day for music it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years.it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.mcfly won the best pop act prize, and gwen stefani picked up the best international female artist award.i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years!the flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards.what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close.it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song.it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.little britain comedy duo matt lucas and david walliams presented the best song prize to robbie williams dressed as his former take that colleagues gary barlow and howard donald, leading him to quip he was ""always the talented man of the band"".some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.the song is overplayed and oversentimental.granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good!there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win!much better songs and more timeless.phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote?also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!the us band, who opened the show with take your mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.franz ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best british group, an award they dedicated to late dj john peel.it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.keane won best british album and breakthrough act.if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.natasha bedingfield -

you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people.viewers of digital music tv channel mtv base voted stone the winner in the best urban act category.i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.robbie was a deserved winner.why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?just like robbie.after beating amy winehouse, jamelia, natasha bedingfield and pj harvey to the best british female prize, joss stone said: ""i don't know what to say.glasgow group franz ferdinand won two prizes, as did keane and joss stone, who was voted best urban act by digital tv viewers.best british male artist winner mike skinner - aka the streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit dry your eyes at the ceremony.whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out).then again, well done robbie, good show.but they missed out on best british live act, which went to muse.whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example."
entertainment,"legendary music studio to close the new york music studio where john lennon spent his final hours is to close next month. the hit factory, which opened 37 years ago, has played host to some of the biggest stars in music, including paul simon, madonna and david bowie. however, the rise in digital recording has affected business at the studio, which is relocating to smaller premises in miami. lennon recorded his final album double fantasy at the studio in 1979. the studio was founded by jerry ragovoy in 1968. in 1975 it was sold to fellow producer edward germano, who turned it into a 100,000 square foot studio with seven recording rooms and live mastering suites. his first client was stevie wonder, who recorded part of his classic album songs in the key of life there. other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include bruce springsteen's born in the usa, the rolling stones' emotional rescue and paul simon's graceland. michael jackson, billy joel, jay-z and beyonce are also among artists who have used the hit factory in the past, as well as 50 cent who survived an attempt on his life as he left the premises in 2000. the studio made history in 1994 when it won a record 41 grammy nominations for songs recorded, mastered or mixed there, including the soundtrack to the whitney houston film the bodyguard.","lennon recorded his final album double fantasy at the studio in 1979.other well-known albums to be recorded or partially recorded at the studio include bruce springsteen's born in the usa, the rolling stones' emotional rescue and paul simon's graceland.the studio was founded by jerry ragovoy in 1968.the new york music studio where john lennon spent his final hours is to close next month."
tech,"lasers help bridge network gaps an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country. tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. the laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. in 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations. ""in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said mr r. sridharan, vice president of networks at tata. ""heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,"" he said. in some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. this has led chennai-based tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata's core network and the premises of customers. the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate. ""it's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,"" he said. in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said mr sridharan. ""once we get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours,"" he said. by contrast, he said, digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. this speed of set up has helped tata with its aggressive expansion plans. just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. but by the end of march the firm hopes to reach more than 1,000. ""speed is very important because of the pace of competition,"" said mr sridharan.","the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said mr sridharan.in 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps.tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network.the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network.an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.the laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections.""in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said mr r. sridharan, vice president of networks at tata.in some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get."
business,"lse 'sets date for takeover deal' the london stock exchange (lse) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper reports claim. the sunday telegraph said the lse's plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. both deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer. a 1.3bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected, while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. speculation suggests that paris-based euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of 1.4bn, while its german rival may up its bid to the 1.5bn mark. neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the lse is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. however, the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lse's managed bid process. despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the lse's board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerse's 1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-december, in particular the lse's decision to suspend talks over the christmas period. meanwhile, the german exchange's offer has come under fire recently. unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful. others claim it will weaken the city's status as europe's financial centre, while german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid is successful. a further stumbling block is deutsche boerse's control over its clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. lse shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.","a 1.3bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected, while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid.both deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer.however, the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lse's managed bid process.speculation suggests that paris-based euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of 1.4bn, while its german rival may up its bid to the 1.5bn mark.the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerse's 1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-december, in particular the lse's decision to suspend talks over the christmas period.unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful."

tech,"tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems, plasma high-definition tvs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years' time. that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. with the us leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices. one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr). these set-top boxes, like the us's tivo and the uk's sky system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want. essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised tv. they are also being built-in to high-definition tv sets, which are big business in japan and the us, but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels. although the us leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky . ""what happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the uk,"" adam hume, the bbc broadcast's futurologist told the bbc news website. for the likes of the bbc, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. ""we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,"" said tim hanlon, from brand communications firm starcom mediavest. ""the reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content."" he added: ""the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice."" what this means, said stacey jolna, senior vice president of tv guide tv group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers. it means that networks, in us terms, or channels could take a leaf out of google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. but it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, mr hanlon suggested. ""on the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,"" said mr hanlon. ""ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want."" of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces, many of them are about enhancing the tv-watching experience. high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. one such example launched at the show is humax's 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder. one of the us's biggest satellite tv companies, directtv, has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours. and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with tivo, called tivotogo, which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices. all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.","what this means, said stacey jolna, senior vice president of tv guide tv group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers.these set-top boxes, like the us's tivo and the uk's sky system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised tv.with home theatre systems, plasma high-definition tvs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years' time.it means that networks, in us terms, or channels could take a leaf out of google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them, instead of being external boxes.one such example launched at the show is humax's 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder.one of the us's biggest satellite tv companies, directtv, has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as ""brand identity"" and viewer loyalty to channels.with the us leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, mr hanlon suggested.one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr)."
politics,"election 'could be terror target' terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election, london's most senior police officer has said. sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain's general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk's presidency of the european union and g8, he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real. the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals, warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be ""unwise"" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said: ""terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate. ""this year we are responsible for the eu presidency, presidency of the g8, a royal wedding and a general election. ""there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with."" sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers. home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""we believe the threat is real."" the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier, writing in the daily telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were ""difficult issues for any government"". the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition, with the government's majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted: ""there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack."" tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of ""using national security for political point scoring"". liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour's ""authoritarian"" response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.","sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers.sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain's general election last year.sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be ""unwise"" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack.terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election, london's most senior police officer has said.no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk's presidency of the european union and g8, he said.tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of ""using national security for political point scoring"".he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack.he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received.asked about sir ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""we believe the threat is real."""
sport,"wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager. the ex-england coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed dave jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season. wolves chairman rick hayward said: ""we're delighted glenn is here. he has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works."" hoddle, who will work alongside stuart gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by spurs in 2003. gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when hoddle was manager at southampton. ""i'm delighted to be here,"" said hoddle. ""i saw the massive potential that wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the premiership parallels my ambitions.

""we hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term,"" he said. ""most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn't work out. ""for somebody of glenn's calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line, it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here."" hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones' departure. ""he was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things,"" he explained. ""five weeks later we're back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for wolves."" hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job. his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. the 47-year-old later returned to management with southampton, where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves. he engineered an upturn in saints' fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season. since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton. wolves are currently 17th in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday.","gray, who has been caretaker manager, was assistant boss when hoddle was manager at southampton.glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager.hoddle, who will work alongside stuart gray, has been out of the game since he was sacked by spurs in 2003.the ex-england coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed dave jones, who was sacked after the club's poor start to the season.the 47-year-old later returned to management with southampton, where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves.""i'm delighted to be here,"" said hoddle.""stuart gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager.wolves chief executive jez moxey defended the decision to give hoddle a short-term contract.wolves chairman rick hayward said: ""we're delighted glenn is here.hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones' departure."

tech,"blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft's then new xbox console. its sharp graphics and novel gameplay, with the main character able to pause, slow, rewind and fast-forward time, were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. thankfully, the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters. the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game. as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters. the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal. as in the original, your feline persona can control time, but this time the pigs get to control space. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive. annoyingly, the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements. these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. but the game's excellent graphics, easily the best-looking platform game around, sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans. blinx 2 is out on xbox now.","the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft's then new xbox console.as in the original, your feline persona can control time, but this time the pigs get to control space.this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress.the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal.as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters.the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive."

sport,"healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday's return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations. healey, who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup, has been in good form in the tigers' resurgence this season. ""i definitely still have ambitions to play for england,"" healey told the bbc. ""we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me."" healey, who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career, has reverted to the wing, where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september, the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival. ""i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before,"" he said. ""i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half, fly-half or full-back at a moment's notice. ""but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things."" that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first, healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then, in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday, healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers' third try. ""i caught 'cozza's' eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full, but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score,"" healey recalled. healey, twice a heineken cup winner, believes last sunday's match was ""up there"" with some of the biggest club contests he has played in. ""it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game,"" he recalled. ""there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in. ""after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way."" the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed ""rugby's version of rocky ii"". ""there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done,"" he added. ""it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result.

business,"disaster claims 'less than 10bn' insurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38,000 people in southern asia. munich re and swiss re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said. swiss re has said total claims are likely to be less than 10bn ( 5.17bn). swiss re believes that the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in double-digit billions, the financial times reported. munich re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros ( 70m; 136m). at least 10 countries have been affected, with sri lanka, indonesia, india and thailand among the worst hit. the region's resorts and western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants. lloyds of london told the financial times it expected its exposure to be limited to ""holiday resorts, personal accident, travel insurance and marine risks"". a spokeswoman for hanover re, europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. the company has paid out about 300 million euros ( 281m; 400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the us. but insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through. ""so many things are unclear, it is just too early to tell,"" said serge troeber, deputy head of swiss re's natural disasters department. ""you need very complicated processes to estimate damages. unlike the hurricanes, you can't just run a model."" he anticipated that his own company's total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes, which the company put at 640m. allianz, a leading german insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be. however, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on its business. zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said. most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka, india, thailand, indonesia, the maldive islands and malaysia,"" said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb. ""us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. it's more likely the bermuda-based reinsurance companies might have some exposure,"" said paul newsome, an insurance analyst at ag edwards co. many of the affected countries, such as indonesia, sri lanka or the maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a us-based insurance expert. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka, india, indonesia and thailand, at about 5bn ( 2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about 10bn in 1998. but the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable. ""we cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone,"" said jan egeland, head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. the association of british insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. it said loss of possessions will usually be covered, but the association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.","the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy, analysts said.rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said.munich re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros ( 70m; 136m).swiss re has said total claims are likely to be less than 10bn ( 5.17bn).many of the affected countries, such as indonesia, sri lanka or the maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a us-based insurance expert.allianz, a leading german insurer, said it did not know yet what its exposure would be.it's more likely the bermuda-based reinsurance companies might have some exposure,"" said paul newsome, an insurance analyst at ag edwards co.zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.munich re and swiss re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters.insured damage could be a fraction of the ""billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka, india, thailand, indonesia, the maldive islands and malaysia,"" said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb.""us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure.early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka, india, indonesia and thailand, at about 5bn ( 2.6bn), similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch.however, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a ""significant"" impact on its business.most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds."

politics,"school sport 'is back', says pm tony blair has promised that ""sport is back"" as a priority for schools. the prime minister launched a 500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. ""it's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,"" mr blair said. but the conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' pe within school for 75 of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic. the latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and tai chi being options. launching the initiative, mr blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl waverley sports college in southwark, south london. he said: ""you've got to bring back school sport. it's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. it's still very, very important."" earlier, education secretary charles clarke told bbc news there were at least three areas which needed ""a coherent framework"" and ""dedicated funding"". these were training for pe teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. he added the government had originally pledged ""for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education"" a week. the proportion was currently at 62 , and the government was hoping this would rise to 85 by 2008 and 100 by 2010. the money for the initiative will come from a new 500m fund. the 500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said: ""i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer."" he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an ""anti-competitive sport agenda"" had been pursued in recent years. martin ward, of the secondary heads association, said members did not like ""ring-fenced funds"" and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.","he said: ""you've got to bring back school sport.the prime minister launched a 500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010.shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said: ""i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.""but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee.""it's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,"" mr blair said.the 500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400.he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an ""anti-competitive sport agenda"" had been pursued in recent years.tony blair has promised that ""sport is back"" as a priority for schools."
sport,"chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury. thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry's quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas' knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry's opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and, with his back to goal, henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch, turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes. gunners keeper manuel almunia, who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann, did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry's powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal's weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately, henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and, given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly, henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall. this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea's main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia. arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal. almunia, lauren, toure, campbell, cole, pires, flamini, fabregas, reyes (clichy 82), bergkamp (van persie 82), henry. subs not used: senderos, hoyte, lehmann. cole. henry 2, 29. cech, paulo ferreira, ricardo carvalho (drogba 45), terry, gallas, duff, tiago (bridge 45), makelele, lampard, robben, gudjohnsen (parker 77). subs not used: kezman, cudicini. robben, drogba, lampard. terry 17, gudjohnsen 46. 38,153 g poll (hertfordshire).","thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header.henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes.henry's quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas' knockback.henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected.arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards.henry 2, 29.almunia, lauren, toure, campbell, cole, pires, flamini, fabregas, reyes (clichy 82), bergkamp (van persie 82), henry.almost immediately, henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort.lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again.cech, paulo ferreira, ricardo carvalho (drogba 45), terry, gallas, duff, tiago (bridge 45), makelele, lampard, robben, gudjohnsen (parker 77).this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead.a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury.one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia."

""my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,"" he said. ""and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative."" in the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100 debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, george osborne, said: ""this was more talk from gordon brown.

business,"battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy. the greenback hit 1.3516 in thin new york trade, before rallying to 1.3509. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about 1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits. meanwhile, france's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls. herve gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of g7 countries in february. ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. ""it's absolutely essential that at the meeting of the g7 our american friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level,"" said mr gaymard. thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12 in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity. commerce department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the us economy - grew just 0.2 last month. the figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8 rise in october. the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters. the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002. the us says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly. statements from president bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin us deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. but while some observers said the quiet trade on thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. ""i can see it finishing the year around 1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro dollar in 2005, finishing the year around 1.40,"" said adrian hughes, currency strategist with hsbc in london.","the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy.thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12 in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about 1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits.meanwhile, france's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls.the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002.ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies."

tech,"gamer buys 26,500 virtual land a 22-year-old gamer has spent 26,500 ( 13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg). the australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker deathifier, bought the island in an online auction. the land exists within the game project entropia, an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares. earlier this year economists calculated that these massively multi-player online role-playing games (mmorpgs) have a gross economic impact equivalent to the gdp of the african nation of namibia. ""this is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau,"" said marco behrmann, director of community relations at mindark, the game's developer. the virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. he has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes. ""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier. the entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into ped (project entropia dollars) and back again into real money. ten peds are the equivalent to one us dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ( 5) and shogun armour ( 1.70) gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating peds through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the entropia universe. mmorpgs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. almost 200,000 people are registered players on project entropia.","the land exists within the game project entropia, an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other.entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares.deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold.the australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker deathifier, bought the island in an online auction.""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier.a 22-year-old gamer has spent 26,500 ( 13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg)."

sport,"chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1) john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez's header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too, after mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. riise could not have connected any better with morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal, the quickest-ever in a league cup final, stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues' attacking chances were limited, and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard's powerfully-struck drive and drogba's low shot. despite their frustration, chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool's well-organised defence. joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore, but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless, liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from gudjohnsen's header, then to smother william gallas' follow-up. and despite chelsea's possession, it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman's feet, while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval, drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from glen johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite liverpool's desperate attacks, chelsea clung on to win. dudek, finnan, carragher, hyypia, traore (biscan 67), luis garcia, gerrard, hamann, riise, kewell (nunez 56), morientes (baros 74). subs not used: pellegrino, carson. hyypia, traore, hamann, carragher. riise 1, nunez 113. cech, paulo ferreira, ricardo carvalho, terry, gallas (kezman 74), jarosik (gudjohnsen 45), lampard, makelele, cole (johnson 81), drogba, duff. subs not used: pidgeley, tiago. lampard, kezman, drogba, duff. gerrard 79 og, drogba 107, kezman 112. 78,000 s bennett (kent).","there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite liverpool's desperate attacks, chelsea clung on to win.dudek, finnan, carragher, hyypia, traore (biscan 67), luis garcia, gerrard, hamann, riise, kewell (nunez 56), morientes (baros 74).and the blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle.blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game.gerrard 79 og, drogba 107, kezman 112.lampard, kezman, drogba, duff.and despite chelsea's possession, it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech.that prompted mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining.but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later -

""adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can't and they deserve to be protected,"" said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting. ""industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn't play."" roger bennett, director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association, said: ""a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting.

""we will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional."" mr florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion. ""it's the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn't really sell the emotion. ""with ps3 and xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons,"" he said. ""with that increased firepower, the finding nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive."" mr florin said that more than 50 of all ea's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. ""our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions."" ea said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. ""nobody queues for music anymore."" ""you can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,"" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as grand theft auto: san andreas and halo 2. jan bolz, ea's vice president of sales and marketing in europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. he said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality tv show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game the sims. ""one idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show',"" said mr bolz. he also said ea was planning an international awards show ""similar to the oscars and the grammys"" which would combine video games, music and movies. mr bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities.

sport,"london irish 19-33 wasps wasps made light of the absence of several internationals to sink london irish with a trio of second-half tries. rob hoadley returned to haunt his old club at the madejski stadium, scoring the opening try in the 43rd minute. tom voyce powered through the irish defence for wasps' second try before richard birkett went over unchallenged. mark van gisbergen added 18 points. irish replied with three penalties and a mark mapletoft drop goal before scott staniforth ran in a consolation try. barry everitt, who replaced mapletoft late in the game, added the conversion to become the fourth premiership player to reach 1,000 points. he joins jonny wilkinson, tim stimpson and paul grayson in achieving that target. wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point, but they were denied by some desperate defending from irish. director of rugby warren gatland revealed that harsh words at half-time inspired his wasps side to raise their game after the restart.

politics,"lib dems' 'bold' election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an ""honest choice"" at the next general election. with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two. with his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack. now he is promising to levy a ""modest"" increase of the same amount on earnings over 100,000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. they are to scrap student fees, finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. that last policy will also see about 3 of the most well off paying more while others, pensioners in particular, will pay less. labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed. inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings, while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases. in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. but, unlike the old tory-labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see ""modest"" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts. similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration, with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not ""foment an artificial debate"" about immigration and attacking michael howard's proposals for quotas. once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, mr kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party. mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the tories were not going to be ""significant players"" in the poll. he repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. mr kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a ""massive vote of no confidence "" in tony blair's government. that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful, even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election. it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.","with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation.once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, mr kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party.but, unlike the old tory-labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see ""modest"" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services.the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings, while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases.with his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack.mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the tories were not going to be ""significant players"" in the poll.charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an ""honest choice"" at the next general election.similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration, with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not ""foment an artificial debate"" about immigration and attacking michael howard's proposals for quotas."

tech,"ban hits half-life 2 pirates hard about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game. game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of half-life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version. half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run. in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. ""the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half-life 2,"" read the statement. valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20,000 represented. one effect of steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten. even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts. valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts. some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account. some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve's anti-piracy actions. in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. the company said: ""the hack came from the 'community' as do they all."" it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys. rob fahey, editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz, said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system. before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. ""but with this, valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life 2,"" he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. ""it's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games,"" he said. this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.","in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false.before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played.game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version.half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online.about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game.unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts.if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems.authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run."

politics,"anglers 'could face prosecution' anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of mps has warned. sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. the mps said they were ""concerned"" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, mps said. they called for a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect ""kept animals"" and ""companion"" animals by setting up a ""duty of care"". in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing ""mutilation"" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest. the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. ""we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government's intention to exempt fishing as an activity."" but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. ""however, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,"" the committee added. the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which ""would be significantly weakened"". mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished. committee chairman michael jack said: ""any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. ""this draft bill is no exception. my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place."" but mr jack said the bill ""very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that ""an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law"" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms.

entertainment,"german music in a 'zombie' state the german music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said. tim renner, the head of universal music germany until last year, told bbc world service's the music biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive. renner warned that unless the industry accepted ""new realties"" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. ""the problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,"" he stated. ""so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie."" the music market in germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros ( 1.8bn). since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros ( 1.1bn) in 2003. in the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - cd album sales fell by 13.8 . but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold. mr renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging. ""you need time,"" he added. however, peter zombic, the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany, said he did not feel the situation was as ""dramatic"" as mr renner believed. ""it's quite true that we have severe problems in germany - but that's true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,"" he argued. ""we have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. ""i don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to germany talent, the market is quite successful."" he did, however, admit that copyright owners have ""partly lost control of their copyright"", due to piracy and copying. but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. ""we were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. ""at that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the napster time, when p2p services became popular.

politics,"protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the high court. baa's expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the 2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion, heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport white paper could be left in ruins. the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield, leader of essex county council, told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. ""we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper. ""then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go."" he added: ""politicians should not decide where runways should be."" the stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year. the airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow, gatwick, edinburgh and glasgow airports, baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004, which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. at heathrow, baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.","baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick.baa's expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans.but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow.opponents say the 2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used.the stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.at heathrow, baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.at gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway."

business,"iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters. a vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. ""first rule of law, then the economy,"" says radwan hadi, deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services, which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday's election, according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq. job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people's wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. ""estimates of iraq's unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40 ,"" the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded 22bn since june 2003. iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad's pharmacies. observes mr hadi: ""the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq, the jordanian investment bank export finance bank has bought 49 of national bank of iraq. foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes ms alexander. ""it is seen as a selling off of iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers,"" she says. consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100 foreign ownership of iraqi assets, she explains. in the west, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that ""people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things"", ms alexander says. yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists mr hadi, an iraqi who left the country three decades ago. ""i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" mr hadi says. ""iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."" many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi's blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch's baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, mr hadi points out.

""we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp. ""yet britain's response has shone a light on our nation's character. the last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever."" he went on to reflect on the values that ""most britons hold dear"". looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to ""turn these beliefs into reality"" and set out the choices he says are facing britain. ""how much tax do people want to pay? who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? ""who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?"" mr blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the ""wrong solution"" to them. ""the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. ""worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today."" the tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. ""we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. ""we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change."" this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account. but labour spokesman mr kemp said: ""it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april, not 1 january."" ""let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment, 15 interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. ""with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country.","tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed, michael howard has said.the election will give britain the chance to change.""mr blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the ""wrong solution"" to them.""let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment, 15 interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax.""britain is heading in the wrong direction"", the conservative leader said in his new year message.""with labour britain is working.the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, mr howard said.this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.""worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.""the last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.""but labour spokesman mr kemp said: ""it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april, not 1 january."""

tech,"be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson. if it gets its way, the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention? yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas. in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you, because they hold the patent on ""one-click"" online purchase. it is a small invention, but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it. we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the council of ministers, radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany's main political parties have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned. the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an ""a"" item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried? first, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow? more directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent. this is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. i have never, to my shame, managed to read lord byron's childe harold's pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files, then i am in trouble under patent law, at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders. even this system breaks down, of course, as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe's computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.","this goes to the heart of the

""twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in europe; now they are more than 50 and we expect this number to keep growing,"" said gabrielle prior, nielsen netratings analyst.

tech,"finding new homes for old phones re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too. research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites. the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk. of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25 get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. the slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates james goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future. ""it's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,"" said mr goodman. many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said mr goodman. far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. ""we've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,"" said mr goodman, ""but there's a strong social argument too."" older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. ""it's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network,"" said mr goodman, ""and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."" but the relatively low wages in romania, which is one of the poorest countries in europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. ""the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,"" he said. reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. georgeta minciu, a romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me."" ""this is the only way i can afford to have a phone,"" she said. mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. but, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. ""if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,"" he said.","mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain's mobile mountain made it overseas.""this is the only way i can afford to have a phone,"" she said.older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model.re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets.""it's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,"" said mr goodman.research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide.georgeta minciu, a romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages.the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk."
tech,"poles play with gameboy 'blip-pop' a group of artists in poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on nintendo's handheld gameboy console to a new level. the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed ""blip-pop."" think of it as donkey kong meets norman cook, or maybe tetris takes on kraftwerk. any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. all the sounds are made by six nintendo gameboys, with a mixture of older models and newer advance sp handhelds. the gameboyzz orchestra project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board. jarek kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now. ""i was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine,"" said kujda. he realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. he wondered, if one gameboy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born. ""gameboyzz orchestra project is more of an improvisational project,"" said kudja. ""we prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert."" the group plays maybe four or five shows a year. malgorzata kujda, jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise. ""for example, i make music with more hard beats and noises,"" she said. ""but each of us makes another music, a different sound. and then in the concert we just improvise, and that i think is more fun for us."" the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. some love the group's music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it. in the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. but jarek kujda says they try to be unique.

tech,"fast moving phone bugs appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs. the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system. despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir. the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time. however, the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian's series 60 software is licenced by nokia, lg electronics, lenovo, panasonic, samsung, sendo and siemens.","the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range.however, the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range.finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone.the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system.despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir.a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time."
business,"novartis hits acquisition trail swiss drugmaker novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ( 7.4bn; 3.9bn) of purchases to make its sandoz unit the world's biggest generic drug producer. novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of germany's hexal. it also acquired 67.7 of hexal's us affiliate eon labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for 31 each. novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about 200m a year following the acquisitions. novartis' shares rose 1 to 57.85 swiss francs in early trading. the deal will see novartis' sandoz business overtake israel's teva pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics. based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than 5bn, the company estimated. novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts. ""the strong growth outlook for sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,"" the firm said in a statement. generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. producers such as sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost. there are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. however, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. ""this is a very expensive acquisition,"" birgit kuhlhoff, from sal oppenheim investment bank, told reuters.

""the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,"" he told bbc sport.

""the modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in december reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply,"" said global insight analyst howard archer, commenting on the boe's figures. the bba believes that the property market is continuing to cool down. changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november, thus flattering the december figures, analysts said. in october last year, new rules came into force, which meant some lenders were forced to withdraw mortgage products temporarily in november and defer some lending until they had made sure they had complied with the rules properly. separately, the bank of england said that consumer credit rose by 1.5bn in december, more than the 1.4bn expected and above the 1.4bn reported in the previous month.","mortgage lending rose by 7.1bn in december, up from a 6.4bn rise in november.changes to mortgage regulation may have artificially depressed figures in november, thus flattering the december figures, analysts said.""the modest rise in mortgage approvals and lending in december reinforces the impression that the housing market is currently slowing steadily rather than sharply,"" said global insight analyst howard archer, commenting on the boe's figures.separately, the bank of england said that consumer credit rose by 1.5bn in december, more than the 1.4bn expected and above the 1.4bn reported in the previous month."

politics,"'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. if there was to be a cap, it should be 10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons, european parliament, scottish parliament, welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: ""there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.","it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200.there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m.the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions.in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it.the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections."

business,"gm pays 2bn to evade fiat buyout general motors of the us is to pay fiat 1.55bn euros ( 2bn; 1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian car maker outright. fiat had sold gm a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. but fiat's heavy losses have convinced gm - whose own european operations are in the red - to back away. the pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. fiat's shares on the milan stock exchange rose 4.5 by 0900 gmt to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7 in early trading.

""i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. if existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,"" mr greenspan said. he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity ""retirement and health programmes would need ""significant"" changes. he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford. meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red. despite the dire warnings, mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs. since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of 412bn last year.","federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have ""severe"" consequences.he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red.while the us economy is growing at a ""reasonably good pace"" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us.meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added.speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes.as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit."

business,"nigeria to boost cocoa production the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme. agriculture minister adamu bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. the government will pump 154m naira ( 1.1m; 591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer. cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s. but with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. at the launch of the programme in the south-western city of ibadan, mr bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. he also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. the country could be looking to emulate rival ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. however, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. ""people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,"" said joshua osagie, a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters. ""the farmers in the village never see any assistance,"" he added. at the same time as nigeria announced its new initiative, ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. the country saw more than 1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.","the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.""people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,"" said joshua osagie, a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters.nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s.but with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970."
tech,"smart search lets art fans browse if you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. artgarden, developed by bt's research unit, is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures. clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works. the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. it 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. so, for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. ""it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery,"" said jemima rellie, head of the tate's digital programme. for richard tateson, who worked on the artgarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. ""i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn't have a clue what i wanted,"" he said. the text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which he found helpful. he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead. he thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. similarly, with art, browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. ""you don't arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see. one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn't have asked for,"" he said. the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that, said ms rellie. she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.","the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that, said ms rellie.if you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures.it 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them.artgarden, developed by bt's research unit, is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings.bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection.for richard tateson, who worked on the artgarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration."

business,"cactus diet deal for phytopharm a slimming aid made from a southern african cactus is set to be developed by uk firm phytopharm and unilever. anglo-dutch food giant unilever will help the pharmaceutical firm develop the snacks containing hoodia extract. phytopharm shares jumped 10.7 on the news, with analysts saying sales of 600m ( 309m) a year were possible. the plant, licensed to phytopharm in 1997, has been used for thousands of years by the sans bushmen of the kalahari desert to stave off hunger. studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products. phytopharm will receive an initial fee of 6.5m from unilever - out of a potential total of 21m - as well as future royalties on product sales. under the deal, production of the hoodia cactus at phytopharm's nursery in south africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions, said phytopharm chief executive richard dixey. the firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from hoodia with pfizer. but the research collaboration came to an end in 2003. analysts said unilever could launch the new products in 2007.

entertainment,"director nair's vanity project indian film director mira nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make william makepeace thackeray's novel vanity fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life. the book is one of the classics of english literature - the story of scheming 19th century social climber becky sharp, played in the film by reese witherspoon. nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film's second half. ""it was serendipity really - i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features, who had distributed monsoon wedding,"" nair told bbc world service's masterpiece programme. ""they offered me their next-best thing, not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was 16 years old in an irish catholic boarding school in india."" since her 1988 debut feature salaam bombay! - nominated for the best foreign language oscar and winner of best first feature at cannes - nair has become one of india's most famous and respected directors. she is not restricted to bollywood, however - she followed salaam bombay! with mississippi masala, starring denzel washington, and the perez family, her first hollywood film. her career peaked with monsoon wedding in 2001, which won the golden lion award at venice. nair's indian-style adaptation of vanity fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the us - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the bollywood elements as ""jarring."" the film has a new ending, with becky sharp running off for a new life in india. but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray - who was born in india but moved to england as a young man - had seen the world. ""first, when i was 16, it was becky sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because i recognised myself in her - i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,"" she said. ""but it was the sort of novel i somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and i would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. ""as i got older and read it, i think it was thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. ""that perspective was something i really loved."" nair also defended her decision to cast an american actress - reese witherspoon - as becky sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish. ""i cast intuitively - in my films i cast as many non-actors as i cast actors,"" she said. ""for me, it is intuition - i have to fall in love with an actor. it is a visceral response. ""thackeray describes becky sharp as a minx. also she's described as someone who's tiny, red-headed and thin. reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her."" having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part, however, witherspoon then became pregnant. but nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film. ""it was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when i first met her husband actor ryan philippe , i said 'knock her up, won't you, i need some flesh on the girl',"" she joked. ""i'm not a fan of the underfed los angeles actor at all. this was, for me, about becky sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film. ""i love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, i love the fleshiness, i love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with."" nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise witherspoon's ""bump"" in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. ""she runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses - she does everything,"" nair said.

tech,"satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology. a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. ""respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,"" said einar bjorgo from unosat, the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium. the group uses satellites from nasa, the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation. the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. from there, the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. ""you have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,"" said stefan voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the german aerospace centre. this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about 12 hours. ""our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,"" said mr voigt. respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. but the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. ""a map is a working document,"" explains herbert hansen of respond's belgian partner keyobs. ""you need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. ""we print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected."" humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond's maps. they have come in especially handy during sudan's rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. ""these wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground,"" says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit. respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it. clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world, a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production","respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc.""respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,"" said einar bjorgo from unosat, the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium.respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly.respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times.""we print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected.""a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps.aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond's maps.""our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,"" said mr voigt."
tech,"looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts gartner. more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales. ""all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe,"" mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. ""japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years' time. ""they already have tv, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones."" but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. ""at the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical."" nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms. more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. this was not a ""women's thing"", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. ""western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,"" said ms milanesi. ""people are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. ""this year music will have a part to play in this."" the market for full-track music downloads was worth just 20 million ( 10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth 1.8 billion ( 9.4 million) by 2009, according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone, the w800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. in july last year, motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola's standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.","apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola's standard music application for its music phones.third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts.in july last year, motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones.but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod.sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone, the w800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera.this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner.it was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner.but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology.nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own.ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives.more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services."

""the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles,"" explained dr doug williams of bt, who will be nm2's technical project manager.

""viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes,"" he said.

tech,"us woman sues over ink cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date. the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change. but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty. ""the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer,"" the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution, damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as 34 but it could cost up to 1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year. the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk's office of fair trading (oft), which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.","a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp), saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months.the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001.the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as 34 but it could cost up to 1,700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge, a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year.hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change."
sport,"hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi-finals. hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two-set lead. but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider. hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and set up a meeting with andy roddick. the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final. ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets. the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt's exuberant on-court celebrations were ""not very good for the sport"". and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs. the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip, and he double-faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes.

business,"saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden. the car, unveiled at the geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. it will not be sold in the us, said gm europe president carl-peter forster. as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers, the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine. gm's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory's closure. the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations. but the group's new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's opel workers in ruesselsheim, germany. they may now have to face a larger proportion of gm's cuts. neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market. for years, saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw, mercedes and jaguar. the segment's leaders do not agree. gm's plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers. in the us, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe. other luxury car makers, most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. there, german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market. bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m ( 104m; 151m euros) from 500m the previous year. beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations, gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs, opels - badged as vauxhalls in the uk - and now cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar, which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers. but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news. the current trend towards us production was ""stupid"", he said. in a separate announcement, gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models. it is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us. gm said it wanted to change ""customers' perceptions"" about opel and vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.","another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car.as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers, the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine.neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market.""we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news.general motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden.the car, unveiled at the geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.other luxury car makers, most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe.it will not be sold in the us, said gm europe president carl-peter forster.bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.gm's plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers.doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar, which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers.it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us."

entertainment,"how the academy awards flourished the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. but from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today? how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel - just over the road from their modern day home. just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at 5. the first film to win was wings, which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner. the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman's chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday, then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953, with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar? there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar. one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article. the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn's first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2,530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort, the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement? the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5,700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy, receipt of an academy award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics. among the overlooked films were hobson's choice, dirty harry, the 39 steps, the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927), humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944), gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq, but as it didn't stop during world war ii or the vietnam war. documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars, including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was ""demeaning"". writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers' guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood's apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz. the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared ""come on up and get it, frank"" to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade. capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.","the first film to win was wings, which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award.the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines.writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers' guild was striking at the time.the first televised ceremony was in 1953, with bob hope as the mc.opal was murdered in 1979.the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn's first best actress win in 1934.in support of the war effort, the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii.for the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results.douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards.how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel -

""we predict that the next week will continue the same trend,"" she added. it was a similar story at bluewater in kent. spokesman alan jones said he expected 150,000 shoppers to have visited by the end of saturday and a further 100,000 on sunday. ""our sales so far have been 2 up on the same time last year,"" he said. ""we're very busy, it's really strong and people will be shopping right up until christmas. ""over the christmas period we're expecting people to spend in excess of 200m at the centre."" on saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the st david's shopping centre in cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with about 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play. at the st enoch's shopping centre in glasgow, more than 140,000 shoppers - an all-time record - were expected to have passed through the doors by its closing time of 1900 gmt. senior business manager jon walton said: ""it has been phenomenal - absolutely mobbed.

sport,"tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were ""robbed"" at manchester united after pedro mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given. ""the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right,"" said jol after the 0-0 draw. ""but at the end of the day it's so obvious that pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible. ""we feel robbed but it's difficult for the linesman and referee to see it."" mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. jol added: ""we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. ""what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it. ""we didn't play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three."" mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. he said: ""my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. ""it was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - i've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. ""it's really, really over. what can you do but laugh about it? it's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. ""it's not every game you score from the halfway line."" manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. ""i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,"" ferguson told mutv. ""what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays. ""but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. ""thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. so you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. ""i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football."" arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. ""when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford, that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence,"" said wenger. ""it's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.""","""it's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.""""it was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - i've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career.spurs boss martin jol said his team were ""robbed"" at manchester united after pedro mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.""what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays.mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay.jol added: ""we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal.""when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford, that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence,"" said wenger.""but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.""but at the end of the day it's so obvious that pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible.he said: ""my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate.""what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it."
politics,"whitehall shredding increasing - tories civil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the tories suggest. some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the freedom of information act's implementation on 1 january. departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records. but the tories want the information commissioner to investigate. the freedom of information act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years. but bbc political correspondent james hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins. liberal democrat alan beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the department of constitutional affairs - said if the claims were true, whitehall was ""acting entirely against the spirit of the new act"". ""both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny."" fellow lib dem norman baker said the episode painted an ""unflattering picture of the inner workings of government"". ""it is clear that the government's initial enthusiasm for open government has turned to self-serving cynicism."" dr julian lewis, the conservative spokesman for the cabinet office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers. the department of work and pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year - up 22,000 on four years ago when the act was passed. the number of files destroyed by the ministry of defence and the departments of environment, food and rural affairs and trade and industry has also risen dramatically. dr lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner richard thomas. earlier this week, mr thomas said he was looking into cabinet office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. he said he ""totally condemned"" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january. government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served ""no current purpose"", mr thomas said. a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or ""the destruction of important records"". the freedom of information act will cover england, wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.","the freedom of information act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years.government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served ""no current purpose"", mr thomas said.he said he ""totally condemned"" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january.some government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the freedom of information act's implementation on 1 january.dr lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner richard thomas.a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or ""the destruction of important records"".but the tories want the information commissioner to investigate.departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records.liberal democrat alan beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the department of constitutional affairs - said if the claims were true, whitehall was ""acting entirely against the spirit of the new act""."
tech,"creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin, head of the team behind the first macintosh computer, has died. mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released. he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. the 1984 release of the mac reflected mr raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use. mr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. however, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. the result was the 1984 macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh. the gui was developed by xerox parc, and used in its star machine. but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer. ""his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,"" said andy hertzfeld, an early macintosh team member. although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released. in 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with apple's mercurial boss steve jobs. in 1982, mr raskin left apple entirely. the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. after leaving apple, mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. he was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted san francisco's chamber opera society. mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california.","mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released.the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company.however, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released.but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer.in 1982, mr raskin left apple entirely.mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california.jef raskin, head of the team behind the first macintosh computer, has died."
business,"argentina, venezuela in oil deal argentina and venezuela have extended a food-for-oil deal, which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year. argentine president nestor kirchner and venezuelan president hugo chavez signed the deal in buenos aires on tuesday. last april, argentina signed a 240m agreement to import venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now been extended. venezuela will now import cattle, medicines and medical equipment. last year, argentina's severe energy crisis forced president kirchner to suspend gas exports to chile. argentina fears that rising demand could spark another crisis and wants to prevent it by signing this deal. the two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between venezuelan energy firm pdvsa and argentina's enarsa. under this deal, the argentine market will be opened to venezuelan investment. president chavez added that brazil's petrobras could join soon the co-operation deal. president chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a south american oil company, which could include the state-owned companies of venezuela, argentina, brazil and bolivia. the two presidents also agreed to create 'television sur', a latin american network of state-owned television channels.","argentine president nestor kirchner and venezuelan president hugo chavez signed the deal in buenos aires on tuesday.argentina and venezuela have extended a food-for-oil deal, which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year.last april, argentina signed a 240m agreement to import venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now been extended.president chavez added that brazil's petrobras could join soon the co-operation deal.the two countries also formalised a co-operation deal between venezuelan energy firm pdvsa and argentina's enarsa."

tech,"kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates. ""the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals."" the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates.

politics,"what the election should really be about? a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll. we've called for the state pension to be increased from 79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of 105.45. that's what we're calling for. many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. if we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty. we've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. they will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. it's our way of putting the politicians on notice. we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative. in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour. but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around. they cannot take that vote for granted. pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner's full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world. that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment. we haven't worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps. various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. we don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out. it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq. repealing the hunting bill. we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action. we are hoping to hear in the new year. whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid. so there's a lot of legal territory to go. we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affairs minister) alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. it is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything. it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face. it's exactly what the prime minister did not want. he wanted the issue off the table until after the election. people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. it is another sort of form of shooting for sport. the principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant. we will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it. i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilise public opinion. everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban. the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. it's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. we want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice. firstly, we have our website. it features our campaigns and changes every day. secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. we will invite the opinion formers, mps, journalists and others. the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians. i think we will be successful. it's very much the language being used by the main political parties. politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue. fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. we have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about 750. if you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that. if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business. we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. but they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.","the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq.we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors.a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about 750.whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure.we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner's full report into the issue.politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.if we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.he wanted the issue off the table until after the election.but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around.with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it.it's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that.whatever we do, the public don't like lorries -

tech,"'no re-draft' for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps. the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms. the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"". the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, ""computer implemented invention"". in a letter, ec president jos 233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament, josep borrell, that the commission ""did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)"" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004. if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament's request it would be an ""insult"" to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service, for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.","a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive.the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"".supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament.most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law."

tech,"cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts. the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73 of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus. in its end-of-year report, messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003, messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data. older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. ""e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,"" said mark sunner, chief technology officer at messagelabs. ""in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,"" he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. ""already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,"" he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40 of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk.","but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month.mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.other statistics show that in 2004 73 of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months.older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened.in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages.although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals.in its end-of-year report, messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals."

sport,"robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales. robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday's set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france, with either tait or noon dropping out. tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted cardiff was an ""unforgiving place"" for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to england's future. tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular. ""i want more of that definitely,"" he said. ""hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we'll have to look at the video and wait and see. ""we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we've just got to pick it up for france."" his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson's cross-kick into touch, all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half, but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front, the line-out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from chris jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards, with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.","england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france, with either tait or noon dropping out.robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday's set-to with france at twickenham.it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards, with andy hazell likely to make way.and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat.tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted cardiff was an ""unforgiving place"" for the teenage prodigy.his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test.olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour."

business,"bush budget seeks deep cutbacks president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at 427bn ( 230bn) this year. the 2.58 trillion ( 1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by 10 , with more money to treat hiv aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by 4.8 , to reach 419.3bn. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year. congress will spend several months debating george w bush's proposal. the state department's planned budget would rise to just under 23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost 6bn to assist us allies in the ""war on terror"". however, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv aids, the bbc's jonathan beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to 3bn, with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush's proposed spending of 3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of 5bn. a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income. some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to 4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases. the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6 at agriculture and 5.6 at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1 to 2.18 trillion. spending is forecast to grow by 3.5 to 2.57 trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency. ""in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" mr bush said in his budget message to congress. mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years. the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than 200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would ""sunset"", or disappear, in 2010. most republicans, however, want them to stay in place. and the figures also rely on the ""social security trust fund"" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.","president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at 427bn ( 230bn) this year.yet mr bush's proposed spending of 3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of 5bn.military spending is also set to rise by 4.8 , to reach 419.3bn.the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year.the state department's planned budget would rise to just under 23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost 6bn to assist us allies in the ""war on terror"".""in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" mr bush said in his budget message to congress.mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years.but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency.the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower.the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1 to 2.18 trillion.the 2.58 trillion ( 1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health."
politics,"tories 'would cut number of mps' the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected, tory leader michael howard has said. the plan forms part of the party's ""smaller government bill"", to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly. the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election, mr howard told the paper. the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than 80,000 and the tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. ""it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, parliament and special advisers?"" he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said: ""this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the state"". mr howard said the plan would also even out the ""great unfairness"" of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70,000 people, mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66,000, in wales just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was ""consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom"" if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.

sport,"reaction from spanish press england's 1-0 defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on thursday. controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of england's black players, wayne rooney's petulance and england's inept performance. but what did the spanish press make of the affair? bbc sport looks at the reaction. there is little coverage of the racist chanting on wednesday night's game. but as does cover the english reaction to the pre-match comments from spain coach luis aragones, who highlighted britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october. journalist guillem balague writes: ""in our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the english nervous."" marca refers in passing to the booing of england's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of ""ole"" which greeted the long periods of spanish possession. aragones' ""no comment"" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as marca focuses on the spanish coach's praise for his players. serbia montenegro's 2-0 world cup qualifying win in belgium - which could make qualification tougher for spain - seems to be of greater importance. elsewhere, the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. ""were there racist chants against some players? this hasn't happened in the spanish league and spain for many years,"" said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido. ""so you (english reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this."" and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones. ""perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue,"" the paper says. ""what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd... rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him."" yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants, with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes. ashley cole's treatment of joaquin, and a frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their ""ugliness"". marca's headline says it all: ""wayne rooney se volvi 243; loco en el bernab 233;u (wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu)"" rooney's display alarms the writer, in particular three ""chilling"" fouls on joaquin, casillas and marchena, which ""could well have left them in the infirmary."" and like as, marca criticises gary neville for ""leaving a message on reyes' ankle"" to remind him of the manchester united-arsenal clash this month. spain's first-half performance is showered with praise, with xavi singled out as the biggest star. ""xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona,"" the paper beams, adding, ""what a work-rate, what dynamism, what vision, what leadership, what a midfield player!"" on a controversial evening, as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: ""spanish football players played better football than the english."" more plaudits are given to the home team, with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which ""spain dominated england with order and quality"". the paper adds: ""the bad thing about spain v england was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition."" vargas does not mention england's two galacticos, simply adding in a ps: ""i have not forgotten to speak of beckham and owen. they forgot to play.""","aragones' ""no comment"" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as marca focuses on the spanish coach's praise for his players.this hasn't happened in the spanish league and spain for many years,"" said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido.but what did the spanish press make of the affair?elsewhere, the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue.and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones.marca refers in passing to the booing of england's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of ""ole"" which greeted the long periods of spanish possession.controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of england's black players, wayne rooney's petulance and england's inept performance.on a controversial evening, as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: ""spanish football players played better football than the english.""""what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd... rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him.""england's 1-0 defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on thursday.but as does cover the english reaction to the pre-match comments from spain coach luis aragones, who highlighted britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october."

politics,"taxes must be trusted - kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue, lib dem leader charles kennedy has said. a day ahead of the government's pre-budget report, mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to ""painful economic realities"". he said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50 tax on top earners. other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises. mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday's speech did not announce new policies. speaking at the commonwealth club, mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. he said. ""budgets have to add up. tough choices are needed in public spending."" the lib dems would cut ""low priority"" spending, including the government's id cards scheme and the child trust fund. those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said. the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50 tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the ""polluter who pays"". the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises. mr kennedy said: ""that contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. ""with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down."" he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government's performance. conservative co-chairman liam fox said: liam fox said ""if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments. ""the reality is, the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face 'tough choices' would be the families who would be 630 worse off a year. "" and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up. he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.","public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue, lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.mr kennedy said: ""that contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans.he said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50 tax on top earners.the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax.the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises.conservative co-chairman liam fox said: liam fox said ""if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments.""with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.""there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the ""polluter who pays"".and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up.speaking at the commonwealth club, mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver."

business,"venezuela reviews foreign deals venezuela is to review all foreign investment in its mining industries in an effort to strengthen its indigenous industrial output. president hugo chavez has ordered all existing contracts with foreign firms to be examined to see if they provide maximum benefits to the country. the review will cover production of gold, aluminium and iron ore although it excludes the country's oil sector. chavez has sought to extend the state's role in all sectors of the economy. the left-wing president is conducting a controversial review of land ownership in the country while also seeking to create a state-run telecoms firm to compete with foreign-owned businesses. he has argued that major economic reforms are vital to improve the lives of venezuela's poorest citizens. announcing the review of raw material production, minister victor alvarez said the government would seek to transfer technology, training capability and content from projects with foreign partners. ""we are defending our national sovereignty over the use of our national resources which must serve the endogenous development of the nation,"" mr alvarez said. ""for this reason we are reviewing all memorandums of understanding, all letters of intent, all agreements that have been signed, all contracts, to check which of these comply with these directives.

business,"minister hits out at yukos sale russia's renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned. economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was ""unjustified"". his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership. on 28 december, another senior economic adviser called the sale ""the swindle of the century"". yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60 of yukos' output, had been seized and sold in december for less than 10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal. baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom. ""we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,"" andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. ""now officials are doing it."" within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities. mr gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov's comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. ""i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,"" he said. ""today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well."" and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. ""if we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses,"" he said. many large russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes. mr gref also poured cold water on president putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. ""the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people's lives,"" mr gref told kommersant.

business,"wembley firm won't make a profit shares in multiplex group, which is building the new wembley stadium, fell as much as 19 after it said it would not make any money on the project. the australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn australian dollars ( 458m; 874m) rebuild, after a rise in costs on the work. any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. it cut a 68m from profit targets for wembley and another uk project. investors were shaken by the news and the firm's shares fell to a four month low of a 4.50, before recovering to close 16 down at a 4.67. the decline came despite multiplex reporting an 11 rise in pre-tax profits to a 67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. increased costs at wembley and a separate development in london's docklands saw multiplex's construction division report profits of a 35.1m. the firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its uk projects - which also include the white city redevelopment scheme in west london - were performing strongly. to recoup any profit from wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. these claims could take up to two years to resolve.

politics,"parties' plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average english bill rose 12.9 . pensioners' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. some, such as 83-year-old elizabeth winkfield, said they would rather go to jail. the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was ""fundamentally flawed"" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change. labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a 100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be ""radical reform"". the party says this year's increases will be the lowest in a decade. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. an independent inquiry into its findings, the lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005. the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. they say they can save 4bn on ""government waste"", of which 1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of 340. it would not be means tested, say the tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of 500. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band. the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa, norway and switzerland. the rate would be set locally, but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least 300m. they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain, because it puts a ""ceiling"" on what the richest pay. the party says it would aim for a 5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a 7,000 allowance for the over-65s. after that income would be taxed up to 100,000. the lib dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.","the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax.labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient.they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain, because it puts a ""ceiling"" on what the richest pay.it would not be means tested, say the tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement.they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a 100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down.the rate would be set locally, but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least 300m.instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of 500.the party says it would aim for a 5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a 7,000 allowance for the over-65s.the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa, norway and switzerland."

""i think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives."" the important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the 50m given by the government so far only ""six or seven million"" had been spent. it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in.

politics,"blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may. the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted. over the weeks, there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term. and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour's stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust. and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message. and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies. during the phoney campaign, labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services. the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour's plans was a cut. and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger ""cuts"". he was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track. a second central argument will be over taxation, with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again. mr brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. as usual, the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum, the war on iraq, law and order and education, for example. but, as ever, it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. and, whatever that outcome, 2005 is set to be a far more lively, even bitter campaign than 2001's non-event.","and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks.during the phoney campaign, labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services.he was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track.then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger ""cuts"".the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted.and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.a second central argument will be over taxation, with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again.the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour's stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust."

tech,"microsoft sets sights on spyware windows users could soon be paying microsoft to keep pcs free of spyware. following the takeover of anti-spyware firm giant, microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs. although initially free, microsoft has not ruled out charging people who want to keep this toolkit up to date. surveys show that almost every windows pc is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data. microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up windows machines should be available within 30 days. designed for pcs running windows 2000 and xp, the utility will clean out spyware programs, constantly monitor what happens on a pc and will be regularly updated to catch the latest variants. before now many of microsoft's other security boosting programs, such as the firewall in windows xp, have been given away free. but mike nash, vice president in microsoft's security business unit, said it was still working out pricing and licensing issues. charging for future versions has not been discounted, he said. ""we'll come up with a plan and roll that out,"" he said. the plan could turn out to be a lucrative one for microsoft. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90 of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware. spyware comes in many forms and at its most benign exploits lazy browsing habits to install itself and subject users to unwanted adverts. other forms hijack net browser settings to force people to view pages they would otherwise never visit. at its most malign, spyware watches everything that people do with their pc and steals login information and other personal data. microsoft's announcement about spyware comes after it bought small new york software firm giant company software. terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.","windows users could soon be paying microsoft to keep pcs free of spyware.microsoft said that a beta version of the toolkit to clean up windows machines should be available within 30 days.surveys show that almost every windows pc is infested with spyware programs that do everything from bombard users with adverts to steal login data.following the takeover of anti-spyware firm giant, microsoft said it would soon release a toolkit that strips machines of the irritating programs.although initially free, microsoft has not ruled out charging people who want to keep this toolkit up to date.designed for pcs running windows 2000 and xp, the utility will clean out spyware programs, constantly monitor what happens on a pc and will be regularly updated to catch the latest variants.before now many of microsoft's other security boosting programs, such as the firewall in windows xp, have been given away free.at its most malign, spyware watches everything that people do with their pc and steals login information and other personal data."

""i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here."" newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne's turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window. but the 25-year-old dubliner underlined his intention to stay at eastlands. he added: ""it's nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do. ""i really enjoy it at city and i want to keep that going."" keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in january. dunne's professionalism was famously questioned by keegan, who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state. but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said: ""i've grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad. ""i've played more games than any other outfield players this season so i can't be regarded as being a kid any more. ""i have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough, defensively we've done quite well."" keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper nicky weaver makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at blackburn on tuesday. former england under-21 keeper weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries, which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.","""i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here.""he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances, prompting interest from other clubs.""i really enjoy it at city and i want to keep that going.""but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said: ""i've grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad.""i've played more games than any other outfield players this season so i can't be regarded as being a kid any more.newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne's turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window."

politics,"howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, michael howard has said. as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. some charities say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans. ""by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. in a speech in london on monday, mr howard said: ""it's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."" he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that ""firm but fair"" immigration controls were essential for good community relations. - withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for ""national security"" - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk. mr howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a ""substantial reduction"" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current ""unfair and inhumane"" system. ""we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum,"" mr howard said. ""by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling."" but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy, which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans ""dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible"". lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down 40 and economic migration down about 10 . he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion ""disgraceful"".","as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, michael howard has said.""we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum,"" mr howard said.and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy, which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.in a speech in london on monday, mr howard said: ""it's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.""the plans would help achieve a ""substantial reduction"" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure.mr howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough.he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current ""unfair and inhumane"" system.liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.but he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.- withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for ""national security"" - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps."
tech,"internet boom for gift shopping cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for christmas shoppers. forecasts predict that british people will spend 4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64 on 2003. surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in high street stores. almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers. about 85 of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group. on average each shopper will spend 220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping. almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29 from german shoppers and only 4 from italian gift buyers. james roper, director of the imrg, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as lcd television sets and digital cameras. mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas. he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends. much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm saint bernard software. the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops. iggy fanlo, chief revenue officer at shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping. ""when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher,"" he said. higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy. the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. ""the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,"" he said. ""the number one reason now is convenience."" ""very few consumers click on the lowest price,"" he said. ""they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability."" consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for 104.99. in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans.","the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said.""the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,"" he said.mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas.iggy fanlo, chief revenue officer at shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping.on average each shopper will spend 220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping.he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular.about 85 of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group.forecasts predict that british people will spend 4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64 on 2003.surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online.almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers.much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm saint bernard software.almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29 from german shoppers and only 4 from italian gift buyers.a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends.many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country."

tech,"ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs. the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed. bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs, makers of the blogger software, in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone, vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us, said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it. ""the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,"" he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask's my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.

business,"us interest rate rise expected us interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since june following the us federal reserve's latest rate-setting meeting later on tuesday. borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25 . the move comes as a recovery in the us economy, the world's biggest, shows signs of robustness and sustainability. the dollar's record-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. ""we are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher,"" said ken kim, an analyst at stone mccarthy research. ""it's not a risk, it's actually happening."" mr kim added that borrowing costs could rise further. the fed has said that it will move in a ""measured"" way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted by sluggish us and global growth. with the economic picture now looking more rosy, the fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in june, august, september and november. although the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9 in the three months to september, analysts warn that fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery's sails. earlier this month figures showed that job creation is still weak, while consumer confidence is subdued.

politics,"brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time, tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other. this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists: ""i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose."" and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election. so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well, not really, as it happens. and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared: ""i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers"" before catching himself on and quickly adding: ""in so far as i read them of course."" he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men. as far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations. either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly, the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt. then, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw, aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed ""should"" be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister's ""turf"" - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that, unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry, it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.","it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.the prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign.and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it -

business,"card fraudsters 'targeting web' new safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments, an anti-fraud agency has said. anti-fraud consultancy retail decisions says 'card-not-present' fraud, where goods are paid for online or by phone, has risen since the start of 2005. the introduction of 'chip and pin' cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street. but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, retail decisions said. the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature. retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was ""no doubt"" that chip and pin would ""reduce card fraud in the card-present environment"". ""however, it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet, mail order, telephone order and interactive tv,"" he said.

""the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,"" said mr clump. nearly two thirds - 65 - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. of these, 83 were happy with the experience, though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. however, only 34 said they had received replacement cards with the necessary 'chip' technology from all their card providers. furthermore, 16 said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30 said only some had. uk shoppers spent 5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available from the association of payment clearing services (apacs). altogether, card scams on uk-issued cards totalled 402.4m in 2003. card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6 to 116.4m, making it the biggest category even then. within this, internet fraud totalled 43m, apacs' figures show.","the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature.however, only 34 said they had received replacement cards with the necessary 'chip' technology from all their card providers.furthermore, 16 said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30 said only some had.new safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments, an anti-fraud agency has said.retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was ""no doubt"" that chip and pin would ""reduce card fraud in the card-present environment"".the introduction of 'chip and pin' cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street.""the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,"" said mr clump.but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, retail decisions said."
sport,"ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal's thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze. ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united's controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy's foul on ashley cole for which he got a three-game ban. ""we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible,"" he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before half-time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze's head. the striker protested his innocence - and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour.

tech,"big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice. the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements. for its part, the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue, adapting the console game rising sun. call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa. it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. on a near-identical note, medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. its arenas are the war's pacific battles, including guadalcanal and pearl harbour. you play one character throughout, a raw and rather talkative us soldier. both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. when this works, it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. when it does not, it is tedious. a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault, where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii. you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes, then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman, before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. this pair of games do not really accomplish that, being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience. call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. finest hour has a similar determination, framing everything in moody wartime music, archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs. letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour, even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. the game's drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc. the mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. call of duty on pc was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky, not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim, yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot, which happens regularly, you are set harshly far back, and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. the game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that. it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent, the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive. both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. and in pacific assault in particular, their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless. but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial, designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. of the two games, pacific assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. it engages you very well and also looks wonderful, making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry, although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. finest hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.","for its part, the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue, adapting the console game rising sun.on a near-identical note, medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action.call of duty on pc was more detailed, plot-wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready.of the two games, pacific assault gets more things right, including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements.the game wants to be a challenge, and is, and many players will like it for that.those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented.it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game.finest hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming.the mouse control is a big reason why, along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety.the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa.it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along.this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic."

business,"yukos owner sues russia for 28bn the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for 28.3bn ( 15.2bn). the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos' main production arm, yugansk, to state-run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. group menatep, the gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51 of yukos, says this was illegal. menatep has already asked rosneft to repay a 900m loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. the russian government's argument for selling yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that yukos owed more than 27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. it accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities, and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze yukos accounts and seize yugansk. but critics say the sell-off, and the assault on yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. according to menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. ""we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,"" said tim osborne, a director of group menatep. ""the time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today."" menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from 17.8bn to ""virtually nothing"" since 2003 as a result of the russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97 . according to its paris lawyer, emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60 addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in stockholm or the hague, mr gaillard said. while russia has signed the charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case. but mr gaillard told bbc news that the charter came into effect on signature, not ratification. ""russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors,"" he said. yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a us court for bankruptcy protection. it took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of yugansk - first to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of menatep. he has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.","menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from 17.8bn to ""virtually nothing"" since 2003 as a result of the russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97 .group menatep, the gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51 of yukos, says this was illegal.the russian government's argument for selling yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that yukos owed more than 27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for 28.3bn ( 15.2bn).while russia has signed the charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case.mr khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of menatep.the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos' main production arm, yugansk, to state-run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill.""we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation,"" said tim osborne, a director of group menatep.according to menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments."

""the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of islam, or who are falsely hiding behind islam,"" the salford mp told the commons home affairs committee. ""it means that some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the muslim community."" it was a reality that should be recognised, she said. ""if a threat is from a particular place then our action is going to be targeted at that area,"" she added. on ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded. last year, ministers introduced a requirement that ministers should speak english to a certain level. ihrc chairman massoud shadjareh accused ms blears of ""playing an islamophobia card"" in the run-up to a general election. ""she is demonising and alienating our community,"" he said. ""it is a legitimisation for a backlash and for racists to have an onslaught on our community. ""this sort of comment is just music to the ears of racists."" later, the prime minister's official spokesman urged people to put ms blears' comments into context. the minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said. ""what is happening is that those powers are aimed at those who are suspected of carrying out or planning certain activity who happen to come from one community.

""we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists,"" said professor kerstin dautenhahn, project leader at hertfordshire. ""our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans."" the research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. ""without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds,"" professor dautenhahn told bbc news online. ""and i want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots,"" she added. in most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with groups of people. to find out how they would react, the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children. showing off its skills at the science museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. it even used speech to give instructions and play music. however, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the ""robotiquette"" for human interaction.

tech,"open source leaders slam patents the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents. in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. mitchell kapor, chairman of the mozilla foundation, warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft's windows. it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles, which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available. other companies are expected to follow suit. there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office. ""some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can't afford to take them to court,"" said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office. some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. ""if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they're going to unleash the wmds,"" mr kapor is reported as saying. microsoft did not want to comment directly, referring the issue instead to trade body intellect, of which it is a member. ""as far as intellect is concerned, open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems,"" said spokeswoman jill sutherland. ""the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software,"" ""we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other,"" she added.","in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement.there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted.""the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software,"" ""we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other,"" she added.""as far as intellect is concerned, open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems,"" said spokeswoman jill sutherland.the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents.some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future."

business,"china suspends 26 power projects china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the three gorges dam, on environmental grounds. the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river. ""construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website. some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004, china increased its generating capacity by 12.6 , or 440,700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the 22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant. the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river, which is part of a united nations world heritage site, the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze, mekong and nu (also known as the salween), according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.","the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity.china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the three gorges dam, on environmental grounds.second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the 22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.""construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website.the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year.topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china.the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments.altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted.the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad."

politics,"police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told mps. association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox's comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics' calls for the law change to be delayed. instead, the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned, he argued. acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting, mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact. ""if it's 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there's not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn't open on sunday anyway. ""this is about getting through to the management that they can't run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions."" under acpo's proposal, the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods. mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself. ""it's making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse, and the strategic planning process has been less than useless,"" he said. mr fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers. ""staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people aren't being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street,"" he said.

""we are not able to comment on pending litigation,"" revolution studios spokesman sean dudas said. in tears of the sun willis plays a us military commander who disobeys orders to try and help save a doctor and patients trapped in the nigerian jungle. directed by antoine fuqua, the film was poorly received by critics and did not perform strongly at the box office. according to the lawsuit, the injury was suffered during the firing of explosions as part of a special effect. the explosions, known as squibs, were intended to ""simulate the appearance of bullets striking the ground"". the lawsuit said willis has endured ""extreme mental, physical and emotional pain and suffering."" there were no specific details on the injuries. while willis does not seek specific monetary damages, the lawsuit noted that the star ""was required to and did employ physicians and other medical personnel"". it stated he will incur additional future medical expenses. the lawsuit said revolution studios and special effects foreman joe pancake ""had a duty to willis to ensure that the squibs were inspected, set up, placed and detonated in a safe manner, and to employ technicians who were trained and competent in their use"".","actor bruce willis is suing revolution studios over an injury he said he suffered while making tears of the sun.the lawsuit said willis has endured ""extreme mental, physical and emotional pain and suffering.""the lawsuit said the star has endured mental and physical injuries as a result of the alleged incident.while willis does not seek specific monetary damages, the lawsuit noted that the star ""was required to and did employ physicians and other medical personnel"".the lawsuit said revolution studios and special effects foreman joe pancake ""had a duty to willis to ensure that the squibs were inspected, set up, placed and detonated in a safe manner, and to employ technicians who were trained and competent in their use"".willis is seeking medical expenses after he said he was hit in the head by a firework during the filming of the 2002 movie, produced by the firm."
business,"winn-dixie files for bankruptcy us supermarket group winn-dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by wal-mart. winn-dixie, once among the most profitable of us grocers, said chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. it said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. the jacksonville, florida-based firm has total debts of 1.87bn ( 980m). in its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as us foods giant kraft foods, which it owes 15.1m. analysts say winn-dixie had not kept up with consumers' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. a 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, winn-dixie's slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. the company's new chief executive peter lynch said winn-dixie would use the chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. ""this includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,"" he said. yet evan mann, a senior bond analyst at gimme credit, said mr lynch's job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers.

politics,"ukip's secret weapon? by any measure, new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner. this is the man who, some pundits believe, was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton's sensational 1992 comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party's not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris, it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics. so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject, morris appears almost evangelical. ""i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was ukip leader roger knapman. ""i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there"". but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him? many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics. ""i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism"". a great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september. ""it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better, who don't believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined. ""that's international bankers, the world trade organisation, the international monetary fund, the world bank and, primarily, the european union"". so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable. ""the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can't possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do). ""it's like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying: 'before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody'"". possibly a very american analogy, but another great soundbite. ""the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it"". so is ukip's job to destroy the tories, as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared? ""no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move. ""but it's not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"". and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites. ""robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one"". so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough? ""look, we are not going to be forming the next government,"" he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so, with limited resources, the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll. ""the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it"". ""anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment. ""labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"". that might, he suggests, lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task, surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking. ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all, he has a reputation to sustain.","so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus.the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.""anything can happen in the next general election.so what is the big plan for the general election.but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking.as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain.so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro"".and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.""i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was ukip leader roger knapman.and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.on this subject, morris appears almost evangelical.""the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries).but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him?neither does ukip have to fight every seat.but morris is no ideologue.many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics.""labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice"".he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and, more recently, politicians from mexico to uruguay."
business,"market unfazed by aurora setback as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe. the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner, p o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival's share price, from 35 to 36.20. other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 gmt carnival's shares in london were down a single penny, or 0.03 , at 32.26. why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? ""the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says deutsche bank's simon champion. ""it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events."" despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. ""carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" mr champion. similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk, both for carnival and its main competitor, royal caribbean. ""while not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,"" wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday. ""moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises."" after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash. assuming that citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in carnival's favour. in the wake of p o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, ""slowing supply growth"" is a certainty, said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.","despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003.and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.and its owner, p o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco.in the wake of p o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly.""the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,"" says deutsche bank's simon champion.""carnival has an incredibly strong track record,"" mr champion.in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited."
tech,"broadband in the uk growing fast high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever. bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe. according to figures gathered by industry watchdog, ofcom, the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km. asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. ""this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,"" said paul reynolds, chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30 of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. local loop unbundling, (llu), in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer's home or office, is growing steadily. cable wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services, such as talktalk and one.tel, which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4 .","the 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million.the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name.bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter.there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4 .the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands.bt retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30 of the new broadband customers.part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk's most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband."

sport,"desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday. the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000. ""things will be totally different this time,"" he told bbc sport. ""now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona."" chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from rivaldo (2), luis figo, dani and patrick kluivert. former chelsea captain desailly, who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team, who are top of the premiership. ""mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,"" the 36-year-old said. ""we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. ""it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality."" world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for 4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. ""the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,"" he said. ""everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. ""since that game in 2000, chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season."" desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france, the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan, two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar, alongside the likes of frank lebeouf, josep guardiola, titi camara, gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta.

""it won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp,"" he said. ""in the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this. now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes."" shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to 40m. between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage. however, many experts, including the world bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. in part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. ""calculators will have to wait,"" said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday. ""the financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.""","in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman.""our nation is in peril here,"" said ahmed shaheed, the chief government spokesman.expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday.in sri lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1 of annual growth may be lost.indonesian, indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs.""it won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp,"" he said.shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to 40m.he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars.thailand may lose 30bn baht ( 398m; 768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome.""calculators will have to wait,"" said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday.however, many experts, including the world bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact."
tech,"halo fans' hope for sequel xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november, with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time? halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic, halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven's ringworld and the film starship troopers, it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using dolby digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics. but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming. produced by bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera, editor of fansite halo.bungie.org, said: ""bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. ""nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be."" he added: ""graphically it was superior to everything else out there. ""it also had a depth to it that made it stand out."" halo was unusually immersive, sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time. the game instantly cultivated an online following, which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel, halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website, which attracts 600,000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news. when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us, halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. ""halo is the most important launch game for any console ever,"" wrote the influential edge magazine in its review, giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game, it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. ""the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun,"" said errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game. the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. ""it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo,"" said errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game's amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high. ""it does not feel like a game release any more. somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft's history.

politics,"tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the conservatives. party leader michael howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while labour criticised ""extravagant"" tory promises on policing. responding to the plans, the chairman of the police federation of england and wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained. jan berry said: ""it is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned. outlining his crime manifesto, mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. ""the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. ""the trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are."" mr howard said the authorities were not ""providing the local accountability that we want to see"" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible. critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris, who sits on the executive of association of police authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. ""that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions,"" he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and ""could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials"". mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a ""minimum policing guarantee"" with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. he said: ""today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system."" the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.","outlining his crime manifesto, mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.mr howard said the authorities were not ""providing the local accountability that we want to see"" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.party leader michael howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities.mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a ""minimum policing guarantee"" with their chief constables.local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the conservatives.he said: ""today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.""lord harris, who sits on the executive of association of police authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable."

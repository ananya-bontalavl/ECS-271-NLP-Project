sport,"bates seals takeover ken bates has completed his takeover of leeds united. the 73-year-old former chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 gmt on friday, and has bought a 50 stake in the club. he said: ""i'm delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club. i recognise leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times. ""we have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the premiership, and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can."" bates bought his stake under the guise of a geneva-based company known as the forward sports fund. he revealed that part of his plan is to buy back leeds' elland road stadium and thorp arch training ground in due course. ""it's going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors,"" bates added. ""but there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. for the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again."" outgoing leeds chairman gerald krasner said: ""this deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and i believe mr bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club. ""we are content that under mr bates, leeds united will continue to consolidate and move forward. ""when we took over leeds united in march 2004, the club had a debt of 103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under 25m. ""we worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at leeds united. ""eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with mr bates to secure its ongoing success."" krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. he will stay on in an unpaid capacity while peter lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and peter mccormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. the other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of 4.5m in the company for the next four years. on leeds' new-look board it is understood that lorimer will be joined by former chelsea finance director yvonne todd and bates' lawyer mark taylor. krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover. he told bbc five live: ""i am not going into the figures. if ken wants to give them up that is up to him. i can not tell you what the money will be used for. ""this dea l is not about money for the current board. in the last four months i never saw any cheques until this week from one person. i am not stretching figures, we don't discuss internal arrangements."" bates stepped down as chelsea chairman in march last year following roman abramovich's 140m takeover at stamford bridge. in may, he made a proposal to invest 10m in sheffield wednesday, but this was rejected by the club. sebastien sainsbury had been close to a takeover of leeds but withdrew his 25m offer last week. his efforts failed after he revealed it would take 40m to stage a takeover, and that the club will also lose 10m over the next six months. the club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the football league - before bates' arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.","ken bates has completed his takeover of leeds united.outgoing leeds chairman gerald krasner said: ""this deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and i believe mr bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club.i recognise leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times.""when we took over leeds united in march 2004, the club had a debt of 103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under 25m.""we are content that under mr bates, leeds united will continue to consolidate and move forward.on leeds' new-look board it is understood that lorimer will be joined by former chelsea finance director yvonne todd and bates' lawyer mark taylor.the club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the football league - before bates' arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.the 73-year-old former chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 gmt on friday, and has bought a 50 stake in the club.for the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again.""bates stepped down as chelsea chairman in march last year following roman abramovich's 140m takeover at stamford bridge.krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over.sebastien sainsbury had been close to a takeover of leeds but withdrew his 25m offer last week.his efforts failed after he revealed it would take 40m to stage a takeover, and that the club will also lose 10m over the next six months."
politics,"blair and brown criticised by mps labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men. a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labour's election hopes. the pm insisted nothing would derail labour's campaign, despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. mr brown will again be in the public eye at the party's new poster launch. in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity, he is due to line up alongside alan milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party's election supremo - and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday. relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both 1997 and 2001. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday: ""i know from everyone here, in cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown's britain, by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown. labour's paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a ""scorching"" from mps adding: ""it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other."" backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not ""stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing"". lord campbell-savours, a former mp, challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports. ""they told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line,"" he told bbc radio 4's today on tuesday. mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services. the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. he had then changed his mind in june 2004, following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential. ""of course as a waiter for 10 years i have a professional ability here,"" he joked. mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let ""gossip"" distract him from helping a unified election campaign. the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.","labour's paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a ""scorching"" from mps adding: ""it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other.""relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both 1997 and 2001.the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war.backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not ""stop this nonsense, this poisonous briefing"".mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let ""gossip"" distract him from helping a unified election campaign.but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown's britain, by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown.mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government."

tech,"seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony, currently in the gulf of mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric id cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new seafarers' identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year, in line with the revised un convention on seafarers' identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests, which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities, will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises, which operates the crystal harmony, is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology. authenti-corp, the us technology consultancy, has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards. ""if you're issued a seafarer's id in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed,"" authenti-corp's ceo, cynthia musselman, told the bbc's go digital programme. she said french, jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. ""by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection, the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world,"" said ms musselman.

tech,"'brainwave' cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. ""the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,"" said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed. brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. ""the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,"" said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.","although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated.a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes.previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain.the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively."

tech,"peer-to-peer nets 'here to stay' peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts. once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology. the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon, according to the panel. the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content, said travis kalanick, founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with ""business models"" that work for them, which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards. but, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with p2p cannot not happen, said michael weiss, president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out, mr weiss said: ""old media always tries to stop new media. ""when they can't stop it, they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money."" once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004, the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast, two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle, and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal. p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services, like apple itunes, napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months, the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks, not least because of the financial aspect. there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. ""we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p,"" said marc morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer. ""consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together,"" agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands, for example, use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. ""increasingly, what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content,"" said derek broes, from microsoft. ""they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread,"" he said. looking into p2p's future, file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks, as far as mr broes is concerned. ""once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,"" he said. ""file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.""","but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content, said travis kalanick, founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology.the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them.""we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p,"" said marc morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.but, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with p2p cannot not happen, said michael weiss, president of streamcast networks.""increasingly, what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content,"" said derek broes, from microsoft.p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january.but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.looking into p2p's future, file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks, as far as mr broes is concerned.but such download services are very different from p2p networks, not least because of the financial aspect.""they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread,"" he said.peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.unsigned bands, for example, use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign."
entertainment,"csi shows give 'unrealistic view' people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows, real experts say. evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim. lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc. crime scene investigation (csi) and its spin-offs, csi: miami and csi: new york, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic. each episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. ""the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show,"" said max houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university, us. ""this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof,"" he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science (aaas). the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged dna samples in us labs. yet these constituted just 10 of the total test backlog, said dr houck. forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims. ""what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,"" she explained. ""for example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. but when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult."" dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions. the show's influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. ""prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: 'why wasn't everything tested?' well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,"" dr houck explained. ""defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that's always accurate."" however, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. ""my university course started with four graduates in 1999; we're now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,"" he said. dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: ""there's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.""","""the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show,"" said max houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university, us.dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: ""there's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.""people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows, real experts say.forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims.evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim.dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions.each episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal.lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used.""defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that's always accurate."""
tech,"mobile networks seek turbo boost third-generation mobile (3g) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm, siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks. ""high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers. ""while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said dr alastair brydon, author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements. ""the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma 3g ,"" he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised (ev-do). us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are ""expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,"" said oliver valente, sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. as part of 3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, sprint will spend around 1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies, nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2, the uk-based operator with services in the uk, ireland and germany, has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) standard. using technology from lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa, using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson. siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but christoph caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: ""by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren't, those lucrative ""power users"", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.","the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now.using technology from lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps.at 3gsm, siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data.but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised (ev-do).the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences.the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second -

business,"ebbers 'aware' of worldcom fraud former worldcom boss bernie ebbers was directly involved in the 11bn financial fraud at the firm, his closest associate has told a us court. giving evidence in the criminal trial of mr ebbers, ex-finance chief scott sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm. mr sullivan, worldcom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against mr ebbers. mr ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud. senior worldcom executives are accused of orchestrating a huge fraud at the former telecoms company in which they exaggerated revenues and hid the cost of expenses. the firm was forced into bankruptcy, the largest in us history. mr sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against mr ebbers. prosecutors have alleged that mr ebbers, 63, directed mr sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants. mr ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud. his lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to mr sullivan. however, on monday mr sullivan named mr ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud. ""he ebbers has got a hands-on grasp of financial information,"" mr sullivan told a new york court. on his first day of questioning, mr sullivan admitted to falsifying the company's financial statements.

sport,"parry puts gerrard 'above money' listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt. but parry, speaking exclusively to bbc sport, also admits gerrard, who has been constantly linked with chelsea, will have the final say on his future. he told bbc five live: ""steven is above money. he is the future of liverpool. ""it doesn't matter if it's 30m, 40m or 50m, we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will."" on the subject of liverpool's finances, parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard. on the subject of liverpool's captain and prize asset, parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said: ""they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes, but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale."" but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season, parry said: ""i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa's views. ""we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. ""i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. ""we all want to see progress by next season. he's not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim."" it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. ""there have been a lot of open secrets about steven, most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn't had an offer last summer,"" parry explained. ""we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. in reality it didn't go beyond that. ""maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won't. ""our position is we want steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. ""you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. you can forget that."" parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool's new stadium in stanley park, which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenal's 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said: ""i have to say historically it is something i have been against, and i have been on record as saying that, but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. ""i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. ""but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' ""my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium."" some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered: ""i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. ""if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? time will tell. ""i think the stadium will always be anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? i think it would be remiss not to. ""that's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but i think it is clearly something we have to explore."" on the subject of possible new investment, parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as ""a stalking horse"" to attract other bids, but parry explained: ""steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there's no need, and that is not the way we do business. ""we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. ""quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december, and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it. ""steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? ""the door isn't closed on anything. we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year. ""we have a common interest in making liverpool successful. that's a dream we all share, so as far as i'm concerned the door is not closed."" i would take 50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. as for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really? 50m for gerrard? i don't care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go, despite gerrard's quality. through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which i think is the right thing to do. critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash. 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard's transfer for any fee over 35m. parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry. i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed. the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.","i would keep gerrard.but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season, parry said: ""i sincerely hope he will be.""i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else.some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered: ""i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.on the subject of liverpool's finances, parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.but parry, speaking exclusively to bbc sport, also admits gerrard, who has been constantly linked with chelsea, will have the final say on his future.steven knows my views.i think it would be remiss not to.but we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will.""we didn't had an offer last summer,"" parry explained.i would take 50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him.on the subject of possible new investment, parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the middle east.he said: ""they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes, but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale.""critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard.ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term.""you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will.there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.""our position is we want steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which i think is the right thing to do.it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it.i don't care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.that just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda.and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan.i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen.clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell.""i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. 50m for gerrard?he told bbc five live: ""steven is above money.he is the future of liverpool.""we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him."

politics,"asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania. the trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities. the pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims. since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country. under the 1989 children act, public bodies have a duty to act in the ""best interest"" of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania. ""if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania . 'if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."" in its five-year immigration plan, announced on tuesday, the government said it was addressing ""the difficult issue"" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children ""and leave them to rot"". ""we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,"" said the spokesman. ""we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable. ""we do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities."" the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. but andrew hogg, spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. ""from what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,"" said mr hogg. ""in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. ""the medical foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries."" a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.","'if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.""the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania.""we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,"" said the spokesman.""the medical foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.""a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children ""and leave them to rot"".the pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims.""we do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities.""""in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure.""from what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,"" said mr hogg.""we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said.under the 1989 children act, public bodies have a duty to act in the ""best interest"" of a child in their care."
sport,"scotland 18-10 italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield. coach matt williams' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy, chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life. a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back roland de marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck. as the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. italy's de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes. williams' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap. with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland, lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan's men had the last laugh when gordon ross' attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try, converted by de marigny. : c paterson; s webster, a craig, h southwell, s lamont; d parks, c cusiter; t smith, g bulloch (capt), g kerr; s grimes, s murray; s taylor, j petrie, a hogg. r russell, b douglas, n hines, j dunbar, m blair, g ross, b hinshelwood. r de marigny; mirco bergamasco, c stoica, a masi, l nitoglia; l orquera, a troncon; a lo cicero, f ongaro, m castrogiovanni; s dellape, m bortolami (capt); a persico, d dal maso, s parisse. g intoppa, s perugini, ca del fava, s orlando, p griffen, r pedrazzi, kp robertson.","and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes.paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass.scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a de marigny penalty.six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield.italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide.another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors.with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland, lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson.scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson.scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck."

politics,"anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament. tories, lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges, not politicians, should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday's vote in the commons, but faces a battle in the house of lords. the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes ""control orders"", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects. the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects. ""those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that's why we have serious concerns abut that approach,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london's belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march. the new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords' concerns, would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently. in a rare move, the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are ""excessive"". it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan ""wrongly infringes the right to liberty"" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today: ""it gives a minister, for the first time in modern history, the right to detain without trial, without showing the evidence and indeed, in some respects, almost the allegation against the individual concerned."" he questioned why there was ""such a rush"" to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: ""we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians."" mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be ""rash and negligent"" to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests, he argued.","mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees.plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament.mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats.he questioned why there was ""such a rush"" to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away.the new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords' concerns, would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects.in a rare move, the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are ""excessive"".the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge.it proposes ""control orders"", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords.mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be ""rash and negligent"" to ignore their advice."

tech,"consumer concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops, a survey says. more than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk, france, germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number. more than half (55 ) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham, capgemini's principal consultant on rfid, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology. ""acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. ""with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point."" he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands, in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52 ) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned.","mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52 ) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance.he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items.fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties.ard jan vetham, capgemini's principal consultant on rfid, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology.more than half (55 ) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases.consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops, a survey says.at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing.the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low."

tech,"ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic, a small, mountainous state of the former soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting. this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as ""an island of democracy"", the kyrgyz president, askar akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision. the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy, the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes. the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light. however, the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise, any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics, notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government. widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society. the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, coalition of non-governmental organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as serbia, south africa, indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of ""invisible"" ink is not without its own problems. in most elections, numerous rumors have spread about it. in serbia, for example, both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks, solvents and cleaning products are put forward. however, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. the passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections."" the country's widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 february. david mikosz works for the ifes, an international, non-profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies.","the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink -

entertainment,"the comic book genius of stan lee stan lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spider-man movies. many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. born in 1922 to poor working-class jewish immigrants from romania, stan lieberman, got a job in timely publications, a company owned by a relative. he was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. for more than 20 years, he was ""the ultimate hack"" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. words of more than two syllables were discouraged. characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. he assumed the ""dumb name"", stan lee, now legally adopted. by the time he was 40, lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. his british-born wife, joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. after a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of batman, superman and wonder woman, timely needed to respond. lee's answer, in 1961, was the fantastic four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. they were to change lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. they would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. the fan letters poured in. without immediately knowing it, stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. his marvel universe spawned the new title of marvel comics. soon after, nerdy peter parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of new york's skyscrapers. spider-man was born. he was to become an icon of modern popular culture. spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. at last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. and the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too. ""just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,"" stan lee told the bbc. the incredible hulk, the mighty thor, iron man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. radically, lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. jack kirby, frank miller, john romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. daredevil was blind, black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity. lee's influence remains. some years ago the marvel hero, northstar, came out of the closet. in its heyday, marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. until he retired from editing in 1971, stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel's covers. in 1999, his stan lee media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. in 2001 though, he started a new company entitled pow! (purveyors of wonder) entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. his latest project is a superhero based on a real person - jay j armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. but his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with x-men, the hulk and daredevil have all been turned into hollywood action movies in the last five years. but spider-man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost 1.6bn ( 857m) in ticket sales around the world - before dvd and merchandise sales are counted. it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.","by the time he was 40, lee had decided he was too old for the comic game.without immediately knowing it, stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled.spider-man was born.stan lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spider-man movies.so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline.and the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.in its heyday, marvel was selling 50 million copies a year.at last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero.""just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,"" stan lee told the bbc.daredevil was blind, black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity.it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.he was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18.radically, lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work.he assumed the ""dumb name"", stan lee, now legally adopted.lee's answer, in 1961, was the fantastic four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays.until he retired from editing in 1971, stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel's covers.he was to become an icon of modern popular culture.lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne."

tech,"millions to miss out on the net by 2025, 40 of the uk's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study. around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million, or 50 , of the uk, who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes. the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts. the gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said mr hosford. as now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled. those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16 and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""if we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. the alliance for digital inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.","although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests.""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt.optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests.organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford.such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said.the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16 and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts.as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain."
sport,"greek pair set for hearing kostas kenteris and katerina thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the iaaf at an independent tribunal this weekend. athletics' ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. an independent tribunal of the greek track and field federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. the sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. kenteris' lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport: ""we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. ""there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights.

""no individual is, be it the chairman, the manager or a player."" souness dropped bellamy for sunday's game against arsenal, claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position. ""when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock,"" bellamy said. ""i thought 'not only has he gone behind my back, he's lying',"" he said in response to souness' remarks. and the wales international refused to apologise. ""i won't apologise because i have done nothing wrong,"" he told the evening chronicle. ""there's no doubt about it, i am out of here."" the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend, and has led to a war of words in the media. bellamy's claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by shepherd, who accused the striker of ""cheating"" the club. ""i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation,"" said shepherd. ""craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on friday), but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury.

politics,"mps' murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new mps' report. the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse. ""the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor."" at present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. in july this year amanda champion's killer, james ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge. amanda's uncle, lewis champion, told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: ""nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence."" mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty. the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill. as a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to ""remove ambiguity"" over how murderers should be sentenced. it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales, lord woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. the committee said the plans had not reflected the ""public disquiet"" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. lord woolf's sentencing guidelines council (sgc) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. as a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police. mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. he said: ""we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances."" but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals. he said: ""by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act, parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. ""we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial."" shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. ""there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,"" he said. but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference.

""t-mobile has stringent procedures in place where we monitor for suspicious activity so that limited his activities and we were able to take corrective action immediately,"" peter dobrow, a t-mobile spokesperson said. it is thought that mr jacobsen's hacking campaign took place over at least seven months during which time he read e-mails and personal computer files, according to court records. although mr jacobsen, 21, managed to get hold of some data, it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a separate computer system, said mr dobrow. t-mobile confirmed that the us secret service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that t-mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones. the associated press agency reported that mr jacobsen also read personal files on the secret service agent who was apparently investigating the case. a los angeles grand jury indicted mr jacobsen with intentionally accessing a computer system without authorisation and with the unauthorised impairment of a protected computer between march and october 2004. he is currently on bail. t-mobile is a subsidiary company of deutsche telekom and has about 16.3 million subscribers in the us.","t-mobile confirmed that the us secret service was also looking into whether the hacker accessed photos that t-mobile subscribers had taken with their camera phones.the associated press agency reported that mr jacobsen also read personal files on the secret service agent who was apparently investigating the case.a man is facing charges of hacking into computers at the us arm of mobile phone firm t-mobile.t-mobile is a subsidiary company of deutsche telekom and has about 16.3 million subscribers in the us.the us secret service has been investigating the case.although mr jacobsen, 21, managed to get hold of some data, it is thought he failed to get customer credit card numbers which are stored on a separate computer system, said mr dobrow."

""if you look at the market square in nottingham, if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of?"" he asked on bbc radio 4's world at one programme. he warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night. earlier this year the royal college of physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an ""epidemic"" of binge drinking. minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises. it is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once. earlier tony blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers.

politics,"'poll idols' face first hurdles vote for me - itv1's pop idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week. over the next four days, hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election, which is expected in the spring. but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics. ""any of them would make competent mps,"" former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio 4's today programme. mr bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday, argues that westminster has its share of ""odd balls"" and the show will engage ordinary voters. ""if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that,"" he said. but sir bernard ingham, margaret thatcher's former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of ""corrupting politics"". he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters ""with that bunch of nutters"". to give sir bernard his dues, monday evening's opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth's birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance. the contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant, with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie, in the simon cowell, mr nasty seat. the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to ""get a haircut and a brain transplant"". wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked: ""why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled?"" ""don't you care about the inuit?"", implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim. ""i don't care about them. i care about myself and when the sun's shining i think - fantastic,"" replied mr mackenzie. mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes. ""when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax,"" observed mr mackenzie. ""that was an total disaster. i just couldn't seem to think of things to say,"" a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show's presenter, jonathan maitland. irfan hanif, a 25-year-old doctor from bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie's suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs, young drunks should ""given a good beating"" and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final 25, on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts, a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.

tech,"california sets fines for spyware the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california. from 1 january, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. the legislation, which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger, is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year. the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. at its worst, it has the ability to hijack personal data, like passwords, login details and credit card numbers. the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate. one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing. it can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. in washington, congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills, but california is a step ahead. the state's consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. consumers are able to seek up to 1,000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90 of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that, on average, each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware.","from 1 january, a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware.one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user's web-surfing.the state's consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer.the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information.the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california.spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year.currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware."
politics,"will tory tax cuts lift spirits? michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts. should he win the next general election, he has earmarked 4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to. at its simplest, it is saying: ""vote tory and you can have it both ways"". not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions. and even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax. all the money would come from its 35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service. of that, 23 billion would go on spending plans, with 8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by gordon brown, and the rest going in tax cuts. neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash, although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. as the tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories. ""at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,"" he said. it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts. the extension of that, however, was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters. and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes? he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street. labour, needless to say, claim his planned 35bn efficiency savings simply don't add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy. one of new labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy. so far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. meanwhile, the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. so, mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. and, while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.","it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts.ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election.and even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.""at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,"" he said.michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts.of that, 23 billion would go on spending plans, with 8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by gordon brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.should he win the next general election, he has earmarked 4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how.the extension of that, however, was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters.so far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances."

politics,"student 'inequality' exposed teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says. the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. but the percentage of poorer students ""hardly changed at all"", said its chief executive, sir howard newby. increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference. the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50 chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10 . participation at constituency level ranged from 69 in kensington and chelsea, 65 in the city of london and westminster and 62 in sheffield hallam, down to 10 in bristol south and leeds central and 8 in nottingham north and sheffield brightside. sir howard said the report highlighted the ""entrenched divisions"" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. he told bbc news: ""we know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. ""the issue is, i think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people."" he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added. tuition fees and student loans in england and wales - and the different fee regime in scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. the report also showed women were 18 more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6 in 1994. in the poorest areas, the gap was 30 in women's favour and growing faster than anywhere else. the higher education minister, kim howells, said: ""we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."" higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. from 2006 upfront tuition fees in england would be removed, with grants for the less well off. the shadow education secretary, tim collins, said: ""it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. ""tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access."" the group which represents university vice-chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. the national union of students argued the opposite - that the situation was ""likely to get much worse, with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration"". the tables below show the participation rate for each parliamentary constituency in britain:","the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.the group which represents university vice-chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.the higher education minister, kim howells, said: ""we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.""teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50 chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10 .the shadow education secretary, tim collins, said: ""it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education.he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.the report also showed women were 18 more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6 in 1994."
business,"germany calls for eu reform german chancellor gerhard schroeder has called for radical reform of the eu's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits. mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3 limit if they met certain criteria. writing in the financial times, mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in march. the current eu rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3 of gdp. countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the european commission, although several countries, including germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. the european commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules. mr schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. ""the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,"" he wrote. ""only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu."" deficits should be allowed to rise above 3 , mr schroeder argued, if countries meet several ""mandatory criteria"". these include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering ""special economic burdens"". the proposed changes would make it harder for the european commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules. mr schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact. the issue will also be discussed at tuesday's ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 eu members. mr schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. a number of eu finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules.","mr schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact.mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3 limit if they met certain criteria.mr schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions.mr schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact.writing in the financial times, mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms.deficits should be allowed to rise above 3 , mr schroeder argued, if countries meet several ""mandatory criteria"".german chancellor gerhard schroeder has called for radical reform of the eu's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits."

business,"wal-mart fights back at accusers two big us names have launched advertising campaigns to ""set the record straight"" about their products and corporate behaviour. the world's biggest retailer wal-mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. the group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. meanwhile, drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against ""false"" claims about its product prozac. wal-mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal, using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"". ""there are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about wal-mart, but facts are facts. wal-mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the us economy,"" mr scott said in a separate statement. its adverts - and a new website - outlined the group's plans to create more than 10,000 us jobs in 2005. wal-mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of 5.15 ( 3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. unions accuse wal-mart of paying staff less than its rivals do, with fewer benefits. in california, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs. ""i think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,"" said larry bevington, chairman of save our community - a group fighting to prevent wal-mart opening a store in rosemead, california. wal-mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees. meanwhile eli lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug prozac. the move is in response to a british medical journal article that claimed ""missing"" lilly documents linked prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. in the averts, entitled an open letter from chief executive sidney taurel, the company says the article continues to ""needlessly spread fear among patients who take prozac"".

tech,"what price for 'trusted pc security'? you can now buy ""trusted computers"", but can we really trust the pc vendors, asks technology analyst bill thompson. if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer, a dell optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba, hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (tpm) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children's toys. but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. and as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based. at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. it might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor. hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. as a result we settle for second best. so when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. after all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. instead you have to use special software, like hp's protecttools or wave systems' embassy. this provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows, ""longhorn"". this will include what microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the ""next generation secure computing base"", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide. because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (drm) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. users of apple's itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection. but the latest version of itunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd. another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real's harmony service on your ipod. apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. similarly, users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends, record shows i want to watch later, and burn cds for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.","because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights

tech,"file-swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are ""quality copies"". in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called ""trackers"" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to. now the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek's involvement with exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis. users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream. dr johan pouwelse, a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. ""exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said. ""the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. ""the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like kazaa,"" he said. ""there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. ""it's hard to compete with free,"" he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.","sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development.mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems.like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse.""the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said.this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to.""the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like kazaa,"" he said.users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream.""exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said.he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program.one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program."

tech,"supercomputer breaks speed record the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm's prototype blue gene l machine. it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory, a us department of energy (doe) lab. doe test results show that blue gene l has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops. the current top machine, japan's nec earth simulator, clocks up 35.86. due next week, the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second. the speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet, yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles. the us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the linpack benchmark. until the official list is published, however, blue gene l's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. but the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement. surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second (teraflop) mark has been considered a landmark for some time. the ibm blue gene l is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005. its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power, a big problem for supercomputers. the final machine will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the us's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing. the earth simulator has held on to the top spot since june 2002. it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. but in september, ibm said that another blue gene l machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the earth simulator's performance. this was achieved during internal testing at ibm's production facility in rochester, minnesota, though, so was not an official record. another giant to enter the fray is silicon graphics' columbia supercomputer based at nasa's ames research center in california. it would be used to model flight missions, climate research, and aerospace engineering. the linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in october. supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society. their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis. ibm's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, nick donofrio, believes that by 2006, blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing. this means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second. ""when you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world,"" mr donofrio recently told the bbc news website. ""you can start to be more proactive, more interactive and more innovative."" one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing - and blue gene machines in particular - as crucial is health. he believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century: protein folding. ""health is one of the most important problems, not just mapping the human genome, but also protein structures. ""we are a great believer in simulation. it gives you another tool,"" he said. once the structures of proteins are understood fully, then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively. compared with the current fastest supercomputers, blue gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact. since the first supercomputer, the cray-1, was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. the cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second). the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster. started in 1993, the top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world. it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh.","the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm's prototype blue gene l machine.but in september, ibm said that another blue gene l machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the earth simulator's performance.doe test results show that blue gene l has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.the linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in october.one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing - and blue gene machines in particular - as crucial is health.the ibm blue gene l is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005.the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.compared with the current fastest supercomputers, blue gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact.the current top machine, japan's nec earth simulator, clocks up 35.86.since the first supercomputer, the cray-1, was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.due next week, the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world.he believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century: protein folding.the us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed, according to the linpack benchmark.the cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops (80 million operations a second).ibm's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, nick donofrio, believes that by 2006, blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing.this means it would be capable of doing 1,000 trillion operations a second."

tech,"mobiles rack up 20 years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend. britain's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline. the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine's dock to vodafone's head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell, spokesman for vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about 2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes. ""despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,"" he said. ""they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. ""it's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" he said. ""cellnet was forecasting half that."" now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone. cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one (now t-mobile) was launched. orange had its uk launch in 1994. both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. called global system for mobiles (gsm) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.","cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one (now t-mobile) was launched.for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk.britain's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise.the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched.mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on.the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked.mike caudwell, spokesman for vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about 2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.in the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset.now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone."

tech,"the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun. the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003, vodafone launched its consumer service in november, orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. ""show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and i'll write their obituary"" said niel ransom, chief technology officer at alcatel. instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk's first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau, principal analyst at telecom view, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers. moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too. for a start, bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50 of the uk's net using population, can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices

they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.","fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip).voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network.moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.to begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable.motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace.instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities.already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale.kent is likely to be the site of the uk's first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access.the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home.but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue.telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up.it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax.if you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators."
politics,"civil servants in strike ballot the uk's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65. the public and commercial services union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. unions have already earmarked 23 march for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million uk workers. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system. pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.

""television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition.

tech,"when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past. when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially. but, says nick donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm, it was not ""the thing"" itself that actually improved people's lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access. ""when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century, we have to think more like this, but faster,"" mr donofrio told the bbc news website, after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture. ""the invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. ""the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did."" these are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them. we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues mr donofrio, industry week's 2003 technology leader of the year. the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result. ""in the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. ""somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren't quite sure that it did anything, you weren't quite sure if you needed it, you weren't quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool."" but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be ""in your face"". it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage. ""i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,"" says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air. ""people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better,"" says mr donofrio. ""trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know."" natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances. ultimately, there will be, says mr donofrio, no value in being ""computer illiterate"". to some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and ""deep computing"", says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value, according to ibm, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates. but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration. this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. ""i am confident that the set science, engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills,"" he says. ""if i am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. ""women tend to have those traits a lot better than men."" eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says. in the uk, a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 representation on set industry boards. ibm, according to mr donofrio, has 30 . ""our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career."" the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio. ""we believe in the whole issue of global diversity,"" he says. ""our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse. they expect us to look like them. ""as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.""","people will know their lives are just better,"" says mr donofrio.we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues mr donofrio, industry week's 2003 technology leader of the year.but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.ultimately, there will be, says mr donofrio, no value in being ""computer illiterate"".but, says nick donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm, it was not ""the thing"" itself that actually improved people's lives.behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and ""deep computing"", says mr donofrio.ibm, according to mr donofrio, has 30 .to mr donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen.""i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,"" says mr donofrio.but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be ""in your face"".when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially.but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world.the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio.""when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century, we have to think more like this, but faster,"" mr donofrio told the bbc news website, after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture.""i am confident that the set science, engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills,"" he says.as computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.""trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.""""our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career."""
tech,"uk broadband gets speed injection broadband's rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch. an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online. it is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband tv. the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt's exchanges and will initially only be available in towns. it represents a ""big leap forward"" for broadband, said chris stening, uk online general manager. the service comes with a hefty 39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download mp3s in seconds and offers tv-quality video streaming. the service includes wifi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple pcs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. the service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as london, birmingham, glasgow and cambridge. that represents about 4.4 million households. the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt's strangle-hold on telephone exchanges. the process, known as local loop unbundling, was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and tv by 2005 if the service proves popular. ""the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and 16 times faster than most broadband services,"" said mr stening. ""it takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it,"" he said. countries such as south korea and france have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. in south korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a dvd and online gaming is huge. mr stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments. ""a typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. this will basically give them 2 megabits each,"" he said.","""the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and 16 times faster than most broadband services,"" said mr stening.an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online.uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and tv by 2005 if the service proves popular.it is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband tv.it represents a ""big leap forward"" for broadband, said chris stening, uk online general manager.the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt's strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt's exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas."

tech,"games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival, according to its backers. blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including sony, is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005. ""as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images, we have a much greater need for storage,"" richard doherty, from panasonic's hollywood laboratories, one of the pioneers of blu-ray, told the bbc news website. ""so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's dvd."" a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data, while toshiba's hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war, akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out, they will be able to play standard dvds too, which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds. but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy. gaming is a 20 billion industry worldwide, so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. ""the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies,"" said michael heilmann, chief technology officer for vivendi universal. ""blu-ray offers the capacity, performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming."" ea, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were ""ravenous"" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. ""gamers, especially those working on pcs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback."" he added: ""the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion. ""gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution, increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience."" fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting. ""they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments,"" said mr doherty. currently, graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios, such as mgm studios, disney, and buena vista, as well as top technology firms like dell, lg, samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba's hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount, universal and warner bros. ""the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious,"" said jim cardwell, president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox, but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world, and runs from 6 to 9 january.","the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format.mr doherty said gamers were ""ravenous"" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound.both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war, akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out.next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data.ea, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning.blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including sony, is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games.a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data, while toshiba's hd-dvd will hold 30gb.""so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's dvd.""sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations.in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost.as games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting.mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders."

sport,"italy 17-28 ireland two moments of magic from brian o'driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy. a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer's try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia, but denis hickie's try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes. it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o'gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and, for the first quarter, the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs. when they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, o'driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o'gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead. the only ireland player offering a real threat was o'driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over, with o'gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul. an o'gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o'driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner gordon d'arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout. de marigny; mi bergamasco, canale, masi, nitoglia; orquera, troncon; lo cicero, ongaro, castrogiovanni; dellape, bortolami; persico, ma bergamasco, parisse. perugini, intoppa, del fava, dal maso, griffen, pozzebon, robertson. murphy, horgan, o'driscoll, d'arcy, hickie, o'gara, stringer, corrigan, byrne, hayes, o'kelly, o'connell, s easterby, leamy, foley. sheahan, horan, o'callaghan, miller, g easterby, humphreys, dempsey. p o'brien (new zealand)","an o'gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try.a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer.the only ireland player offering a real threat was o'driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer's try gave ireland a lead they never lost.roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.two moments of magic from brian o'driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o'gara penalty midway through the first half.murphy, horgan, o'driscoll, d'arcy, hickie, o'gara, stringer, corrigan, byrne, hayes, o'kelly, o'connell, s easterby, leamy, foley.a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks.when they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, o'driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy."

politics,"'no more concessions' on terror charles clarke says he has ""no desire"" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book. mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour's majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde, tory leader in the lords, said ministers should expect it to be ""substantially re-written"". the bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against. on monday, mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should ""prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill"". ""they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest."" but mr clarke told bbc radio 4's today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.

""i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill."" mr clarke's proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate, shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been ""clearly very badly drawn-up"" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to ""rescue"" the government and make the law ""tolerable"" by amending it in the lords.

tech,"court mulls file-sharing future judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks. the court will decide whether producers of file-sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement. they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file-sharers could deter innovation. they also said that file-trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy. the lawsuit, brought by 28 of the world's largest entertainment firms, has raged for several years. legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy. but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers. instead, they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies. the hi-tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue. intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others, despite misgivings about some aspects of the file-sharing community. it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products ""are essentially tools, that like any other tools, capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes"". asking firms to second-guess the uses that its technologies would be put to, and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use, would stifle innovation, it said. the electronic frontier foundation, a civil rights watchdog, is also defending streamcast networks, the company behind the morpheus file-sharing software. the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation, it said. it cites, as do many, the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer-to-peer networks, upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case. a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered, wearing ""save betamax"" t-shirts. ""the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past 20 years,"" said gary shapiro, chief executive of the consumer electronics association. supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple's ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had, on balance, been beneficial to society. he said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music, conceptually the technology had ""some really excellent uses"". based on tuesday's hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy. grokster's lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up. but this argument was dismissed as ""ridiculous"" by justice david souter. cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year.

business,"yukos accused of lying to court russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard. the unit, yugansk, was sold to pay off a 27.5bn ( 14.5bn) back tax bill. yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts, the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk. but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case. deutsche bank's evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in houston. its lawyer, hugh ray, told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred 27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary. by doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts. but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 december, and then backdated. yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore, who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa, acknowledged the point. he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 december. even so, he told the court that only 480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later. deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz, as the yukos unit is formally known. the sale went ahead, despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. in the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for 9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm rosneft. rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with gazprom, bringing a large chunk of russia's very profitable oil business back under state control. yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia. it also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. ""it gives us a kind of life after death alternative,"" said yukos chief executive steven theede. yukos is currently suing four companies - gazprom, its unit gazpromneft, rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in yugansk's disposal. it has also threatened to sue the russian government for 28bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies, while moscow officials have dismissed yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky, once russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.","russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard.yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts, the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk.but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies, while moscow officials have dismissed yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless.its lawyer, hugh ray, told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred 27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary.yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore, who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa, acknowledged the point.deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos.yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia.it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz, as the yukos unit is formally known.by doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts."

""users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature,"" said professor brian collins, head of information systems at cranfield university. ""users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated,"" he added. bt openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk, told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. ""naturally, people may have security concerns,"" said chris clark, chief executive for bt's wireless broadband. ""but wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up."" he said bt openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot.

""cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,"" said dr phil nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield. ""because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency."" although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is. some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. but many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be ""sniffed out"" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment.

politics,"new rules tackle 'sham weddings' new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force. from tuesday, most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year. but immigrants' group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister des browne said: ""our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse."" under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office. but from tuesday all non-eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'. to get a certificate, costing 135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk. those without a settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will have no right to marry in the uk. once they have the necessary documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. they can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice. rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were ""not proportionate"" and ""discriminatory"". ""these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. ""we're currently taking a legal opinion on this. we'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court,"" ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"". the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added. over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. and last november samuel amoah, a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk, was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office, has been key in many prosecutions. registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. ""they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,"" mr rimmer said. mr rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. ""it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry, for example, in holland, germany or france. ""i think it's a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,"" mr rimmer said.","new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force.the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year.""these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were ""not proportionate"" and ""discriminatory"".but from tuesday all non-eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'.mr rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"".the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office, has been key in many prosecutions.we'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court,"" ms beynon said.from tuesday, most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry.the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights."

""the economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, "" he said. ""growth appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends."" howard archer, economist at global insight said the mpc ""may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside"". business groups welcomed the mpc's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce (bcc) said it was ""concerned by the clamour in some quarters"" for early interest rate increases.

""we say 'i like this'. because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual, i'm riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy, i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i'm upbeat and i like to party, i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning."" kapranos said there was a general ""hostility"" towards classical music, adding: ""there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm."" he concluded: ""we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity."" fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed: ""we need to rediscover our ability to listen."" previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking. kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as ""more daunting by a long way"" than their upcoming brits performance. ""i don't really care about the brits,"" he said. ""it's going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight."" i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels. rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why don't some of the megastars put something back in? some of britain's wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. there are far more important demands on government funds. if they can fund football, why not fund music? areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash. the government has enough problems funding schools and health services. if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that. as a scot living in england, i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success, so i can see no problem with it! franz ferdinand, travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods! i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn't be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship. yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses. there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the ""new deal"". getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use. as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about. only if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they'd had a government grant to get started they'd have more than paid it back by now, so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician. the government shouldn't ""fund"" music - it should ""invest"" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment. i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however, i do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there. i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal. yeah, why not? music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music ""pollution"", if you like. though i really like franz ferdinand, i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago, this was the case with the us nea, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like save the music in the us.","the government shouldn't ""fund"" music - it should ""invest"" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies!areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music?the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like save the music in the us.if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers.as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move.pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff.we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.call it a tax on music ""pollution"", if you like.""but so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.""franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion.getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.however, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician.kapranos said there was a general ""hostility"" towards classical music, adding: ""there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm.""if they can fund football, why not fund music?the government has enough problems funding schools and health services.if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal.i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state?kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland's role in making 21st century music.rather than expecting the government - i.e.many years ago, this was the case with the us nea, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting."
politics,"'fido' to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the uk elections watchdog has said. those are some of the mistakes found under the current system, where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on 5 may as expected. but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election. the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual ""identifiers"" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system. there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the mps heard. and some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. non-british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases. mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at ""hard to reach"" voters, for example. some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. mr younger said using the royal mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters. he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. he said it might also help register students in halls of residences, where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. currently, british voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. mr younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.","the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the uk elections watchdog has said.mr younger said using the royal mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud.mr younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form.the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual ""identifiers"" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature.chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system.the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws.mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register, the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes."

tech,"apple ipod family expands market apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players. its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of 40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design. during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store, which has given the company a 70 share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire, a research director at analyst gartner, told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the market from competition"" so far. ""they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive,"" he said. he added that the threat from others was always present, however. ""creative, other microsoft-partnered devices, real, sony and so on, are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising,"" he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year, he said. its second-generation models, like the creative zen micro photo, is due out in the summer. it will have 5gb of memory on board. digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans, according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004, according to the record industry, with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players. people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows, called podcasts. but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though, and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.","the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth.the company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped.its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb.one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort.the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family.analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.according to mr mcguire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like ipods and creative zens.digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans, according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project."

business,"bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched, german car maker bmw has announced 100m of new investment. some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. the rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday's announcement, bmw had invested some 280m in mini production. since its launch during summer 2001, the new mini has gone from strength to strength. last year, almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. ""our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away,"" said norbert reithofer, a member of the bmw management board. initially, bmw said it would produce 100,000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. ""the risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle,"" said brad wernle, from automotive news europe. the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched, the cheapest mini cost just more than 10,000. these days, buyers will have to fork out almost 11,500 to own a new mini one, or even more for the cooper s which costs up to 17,730. the mini convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to 15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least 8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from 12,556, according to the-car buying website parker's. the consumers' association which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se. the cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 minis, is increasingly being put to good use. there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw's mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for 10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999, when bmw still owned rover, the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 mini-workers. the mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 rover cars. last year, mg rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed, mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.","less than four years after the new mini was launched, german car maker bmw has announced 100m of new investment.last year, almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini.initially, bmw said it would produce 100,000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again.when it was launched, the cheapest mini cost just more than 10,000.these days, buyers will have to fork out almost 11,500 to own a new mini one, or even more for the cooper s which costs up to 17,730.the mini convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to 15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.last year, mg rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge.the mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 rover cars.bmw's mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for 10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium.""our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away,"" said norbert reithofer, a member of the bmw management board.in 1999, when bmw still owned rover, the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75.before wednesday's announcement, bmw had invested some 280m in mini production."

business,"mystery surrounds new yukos owner the fate of russia's yuganskneftegas - the oil firm sold to a little-known buyer on sunday - is the subject of frantic speculation in moscow. baikal finance group emerged as the auction winner, agreeing to pay 260.75bn roubles ( 4.8bn; 9.4bn). russia's newspapers claimed that baikal was a front for gas monopoly gazprom, which had been expected to win. the sale has destroyed yukos, once the owner of yuganskneftegas, said founder mikhail khodorkovsky. ""yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. the authorities have made themselves a wonderful christmas present - russia's most efficient oil company has been destroyed,"" the interfax news agency quoted mr khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers. gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a us court injunction barred it from taking part. last week, yukos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the us in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60 of its output. a us judge banned gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash. ""they screwed up the financing,"" said ronald smith, an analyst at renaissance capital in moscow. ""and gazprom doesn't have this sort of money lying around."" gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase. ""it is a front for somebody but not necessarily for gazprom,"" said oleg maximov, an analyst at troika dialog in moscow. ""we don't know if this company is linked 100 to gazprom. ""we tried to find it, but we couldn't and as far as i know, the papers had the same result."" the sale has however bought time for gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said. one scenario is that baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time, putting yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of gazprom. yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer. menatep, yukos main shareholders' group, has also threatened legal action. yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges. it has been hit with more than 27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20 of russia's oil output is inevitable.","the sale has however bought time for gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said.the sale has destroyed yukos, once the owner of yuganskneftegas, said founder mikhail khodorkovsky.gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase.""it is a front for somebody but not necessarily for gazprom,"" said oleg maximov, an analyst at troika dialog in moscow.""we don't know if this company is linked 100 to gazprom.""yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s.russia's newspapers claimed that baikal was a front for gas monopoly gazprom, which had been expected to win.gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a us court injunction barred it from taking part.it has been hit with more than 27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20 of russia's oil output is inevitable."

""the result of any decision to lift the arms embargo should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china, either in quantitative or qualitative terms,"" mr straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months. but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be ""irresponsible"" and would damage britain's relations with the us. he said mr straw was ""naive beyond belief"" if he accepted china's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe."" when he was in tokyo earlier this week, japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove the embargo was "" a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only japan, but also east asia overall"". washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland, by force if necessary. the us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams, from the uk's human rights watch, said: ""this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square."" but mr straw insisted the eu's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.","mr straw, visiting beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to china, burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea, which he said had a terrible rights record.but mr straw insisted the eu's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.""the result of any decision to lift the arms embargo should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china, either in quantitative or qualitative terms,"" mr straw said.the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe.""uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union's arms embargo on china, despite opposition from the us and japan.he said mr straw was ""naive beyond belief"" if he accepted china's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons.china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons.washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo.washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan."

tech,"wi-fi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru. the pilot scheme in the huaral valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure. the 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september. the non-government organisation, cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the 200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the education and agriculture ministries, and european development organisations. ""the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,"" said carlos saldarriaga, technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes. one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system, with its flagship huaral.org website. there, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. ""water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,"" mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world. cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. ""throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,"" said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""we have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" so far, the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in peru. ""this is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,"" underlined mr saldarriaga. the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. ""it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,"" recalls carlos saldarriaga. ""the logical answer was 'we don't sell any', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing."" now, with the wireless network, cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.","the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions.one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system, with its flagship huaral.org website.the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world.a network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru.""throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,"" said mr saldarriaga.the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems.""the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,"" said carlos saldarriaga, technical coordinator at cepes.it is a precious element in peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,"" mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website.now, with the wireless network, cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september.the non-government organisation, cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the 200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the education and agriculture ministries, and european development organisations."

entertainment,"tv show unites angolan families angolan families who are attempting to track each other down, after being separated by nearly 30 years of war, are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show. meeting point has become one of tv angola's most watched programmes, and has reunited hundreds of families. it runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. every friday, hundreds of people gather in luanda's independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. many relatives have been reunited on air. ""at the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,"" sergio gera, the programme's chief co-ordinator, told bbc world service's assignment programme. ""now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going."" the media in the southern african country, twice the size of france, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. hundreds of thousands of people died in angola's 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing. many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90 of angolan families have lost someone. the idea of recording in independence square was modelled on a square in the argentine capital buenos aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news. one woman, victoria lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in independence square live on meeting point. she had not seen her sibling for 28 years. ""when we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each other's arms,"" she told assignment. ""we started to cry. i felt very, very happy, because i'd spent so long without any family. suddenly i had a sister again."" however, angola is one of the poorest countries in africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. this means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the international committee of the red cross (icrc). in the city of wambo, the icrc runs the gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced. their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. ""it's very difficult - there are many displaced,"" stated joaquim sahundi, head of tracing in wambo. ""as they try to go back home , others are trying to relocate their relatives. many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines.

business,"mci shareholder sues to stop bid a shareholder in us phone firm mci has taken legal action to halt a 6.75bn ( 3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant verizon, hoping to get a better deal. the lawsuit was filed on friday after qwest communications, which had an earlier offer for mci rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. mci's directors have backed verizon, despite it tabling less money. they are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving mci shareholders ""of maximum value"". according the legal papers filed in a delaware court, verizon is set to pay an """"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate"" sum for mci, which was formerly known as worldcom. qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth 8bn. a number of large mci shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. friday's lawsuit argues that the verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the us phone industry will put a premium on mci's network, assets and clients. mci's directors have argued that verizon is bigger than qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. chief executive michael capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing. in 2002, investors in the then-named worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. however, the firm - now renamed mci - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. it is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. mci shares jumped on friday, hitting their highest level since april 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. a takeover of mci would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month, sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer at t for about 16bn.","a shareholder in us phone firm mci has taken legal action to halt a 6.75bn ( 3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant verizon, hoping to get a better deal.the lawsuit was filed on friday after qwest communications, which had an earlier offer for mci rejected, said it would submit an improved bid.qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth 8bn.however, the firm - now renamed mci - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last april.a number of large mci shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company.a takeover of mci would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.according the legal papers filed in a delaware court, verizon is set to pay an """"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate"" sum for mci, which was formerly known as worldcom."

""we want to make the robots useful for people ... if the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated."" emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at 3.7m h. its ""wheel feet"" resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter. with sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. ""i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya shopping districts in the future without bumping into people and cars,"" pal told reporters. hitachi said pal and chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be ""trained"" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years. robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. at the recent aaas (american association for the advancement of science) annual meeting in washington dc, researchers showed off bipedal designs. the three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait. sony and honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. honda's asimo was ""born"" five years ago. since then, honda and sony's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. asimo, has visited the uk, germany, the czech republic, france and ireland as part of a world tour. sony's qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. but its record was beaten by asimo. it is capable of 3km h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio. last year, car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. by 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million ""entertainment and leisure"" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the united nations (un). by the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics. hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.","japanese electronics firm hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called emiew, to challenge honda's asimo and sony's qrio robots.hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet.""we want to make the robots useful for people ...sony's qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs.explaining why hitachi's emiew used wheels instead of feet, toshihiko horiuchi, from hitachi's mechanical engineering research laboratory, said: ""we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.""sony and honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics.since then, honda and sony's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events.robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human.if the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated.""last year, car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot.the robots will be guests at the world expo later this month."
tech,"dublin hi-tech labs to shut down dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, media labs europe, is to shut down. the research centre, which was started by the irish government and the massachusetts institute of technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts. since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. the centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. in a statement, media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us-based massachusetts institute of technology (mit) was willing to fund it. prime minister bertie ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area. about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the labs' long-term survival. the labs needed about 10 million euros (us 13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive. ""in the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,"" said simon jones, the labs' managing director. ian pearson, bt's futurologist, told the bbc news website that the closure was a ""real shame"". bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs, looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing. ""there were a lot of very talented, creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society. ""i have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost."" noel dempsey, the government's communications minister, said mr ahern had been ""very committed"" to the project. ""he is, i know, very disappointed it has come to this. at the time it seemed to be the right thing to do,"" he said. ""unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate."" during its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. in recent months, 14 patent applications had been filed by the labs. many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. the human connectedness group, for example, developed the iband, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. this information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. one project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. the labs, set up in an old guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. it is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the labs close on 1 february. according to its latest accounts, media lab europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about us 10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (us 3.3 million).","in a statement, media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us-based massachusetts institute of technology (mit) was willing to fund it.the research centre, which was started by the irish government and the massachusetts institute of technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts.""in the end, it was too deep and too long a recession,"" said simon jones, the labs' managing director.it is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the labs close on 1 february.bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs, looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing.dublin's hi-tech research laboratory, media labs europe, is to shut down.several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different.the labs needed about 10 million euros (us 13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive.""i have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs, but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.""about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area, but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the labs' long-term survival.the centre was supposed to be self-funded, but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs.during its five years, innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed."
tech,"mobiles 'not media players yet' mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players, say two reports. despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is ""unlikely"" in europe until 2007. technical issues and standards must be resolved first, said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life. fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. ""mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said thomas husson, mobile analyst at jupiter research. ""mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches."" other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of apple's itunes, napster and other net music download services. with phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us, services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but, the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently, tv-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several european operators, like italy's tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe, trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology, one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004, the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens, said gartner. digital video recorders, like europe's sky box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii, nokia 6600, sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44 over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.","the service uses 3gp technology, one of the standards for mobile tv.a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day.""mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said thomas husson, mobile analyst at jupiter research.a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is ""unlikely"" in europe until 2007.mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report.despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said jupiter.various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally.but, the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait.but at the end of 2004, the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe.digital video recorders, like europe's sky box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch.in the us, services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones.people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens, said gartner.tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts."

""it is obviously very, very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week,"" john houlihan, editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news. ""and with halo 2 for xbox out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and xbox."" although xbox sales over the last week also climbed, ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburgh-based developer, rockstar, which is behind the gta titles, has seen san andreas pull in an estimated 24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison, blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took 11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings: the return of the king took nearly 10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets. gangster-themed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2, released on 11 november in the uk, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies. mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2, but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the run-up to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft's xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005.

politics,"terror detainees win lords appeal detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the uk's highest court has ruled. in a blow to the government's anti-terror measures, the house of lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. most of the men are being indefinitely held in belmarsh prison, south london. the law lords said the measures were incompatible with european human rights laws. the men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. the ruling creates a major problem for charles clarke on his first day as home secretary following david blunkett's resignation. the liberal democrats say mr clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor, david blunkett. belmarsh prison has been dubbed britain's guantanamo bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws. the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. however those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday, senior law lord lord bingham said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"". lord nicholls of birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. ""it deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford."" he said the weakness for the government's case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for british suspects. lord hoffmann said: ""the real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these."" but lord walker of gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression. in a statement, detainee 'a' in woodhill prison said: ""i hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."" the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. ben emmerson qc, representing seven of the detainees, said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. he said they had been given no idea when, if ever, they would be released, had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. when the men were first held, they took their cases to the special immigration appeals commission (siac). the commission ruled on 30 july, 2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as british people could not be held in the same way. but that ruling was later overturned by the court of appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.","the law lords said the measures were incompatible with european human rights laws.but lord walker of gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.lord nicholls of birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.on thursday, senior law lord lord bingham said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"".he said the weakness for the government's case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for british suspects.lord hoffmann said: ""the real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.""in a blow to the government's anti-terror measures, the house of lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees.the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the uk's highest court has ruled.but that ruling was later overturned by the court of appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation."
politics,"abortion not a poll issue - blair tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue, arguing it is a matter for individual conscience. the prime minister's spokesman set out mr blair's view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard's stance on abortions. the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are ""tantamount to abortion on demand"". the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law. mr blair's spokesman said: ""the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context."" his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o'connor, the archbishop of westminster, backed mr howard's stance and distanced himself from labour. in a statement, he said abortion was a ""very key issue"", saying: ""the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend, on the way to a full abandonment of abortion."" cardinal o'connor claimed labour had ""developed"" the notion that it was the natural party of catholics, but he said: ""we are not going to suggest people support one particular party."" the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. more than 180,000 women in england and wales had terminations last year, of which fewer than 1 were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks. in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said: ""i believe abortion should be available to everyone, but the law should be changed. ""in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20."" all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp's conscience, rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. mr howard stressed his views were his personal views. shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue. mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews, conducted as part of the magazine's ""high heeled vote"" campaign. mr blair, who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion, said abortion was a ""difficult issue"". ""however much i dislike the idea of abortion, you should not criminalise a woman who, in very difficult circumstances, makes that choice.

tech,"'friends fear' with lost mobiles people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends. more than 50 of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. more than half (54 ) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book. a fifth rely entirely on mobiles. about 80 of uk adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures. it is estimated that 53 of over 65s own a mobile, according to intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. most 15 to 24-year-olds (94 ), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92 ), own at least one. nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced. the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead. ""we're a nation of lazy so-and-sos,"" david noone from intervoice said. ""we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. ""the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart."" one in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. most (62 ) said they had no idea what their partner's number was. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. generally, information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds. but some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. for non-smartphone users, a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. o2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over gprs and gsm. neither vodafone or t-mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use sim back-up devices. it is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50 of total street crime involves a mobile. mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26 more than the previous year, according to analysts. it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.","people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.more than 50 of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years.mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead.""the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart.""nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced.mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year.it is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50 of total street crime involves a mobile.many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem.globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26 more than the previous year, according to analysts.more than half (54 ) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book.the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book."

sport,"connors' rallying cry for british tennis ""do you have it in your heart? how much guts do you have? how much do you hate to lose?"" these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain's brightest tennis hopes in the months, and possibly years, to come. the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a ""long-term"" relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga. and the man who epitomised the phrase 'will to win' before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey.

tech,"why cell will get the hard sell the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different? the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry. ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world, providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. sony will be using the chip inside its playstation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. traditional computers - whether they are household pcs or playstation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. the cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously. this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. whilst its rivals are working on similar technology, it is sony's which is the most advanced. the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance. using a technology called xdr, created by american firm rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel. perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell's role in the imminent ""war on living rooms"". the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi-fis. companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place. microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software, which has been adopted by many pc makers. sony had a stab at something similar with the psx - a variation on the playstation - last year in japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as pcs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack. sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market. by creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. once they have established themselves under the tv, there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems. sony hopes to put cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. each cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your tv, for example. this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. because the processor is so different, it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software, and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight. microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology, not sony's, will be under your tree next christmas. intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop pc dominance. if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future. the revolution might not be televised, but it could well be played with a videogame controller.","the cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future.by creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals.the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance.the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems.the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different?intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop pc dominance.the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint.this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail.sony will be using the chip inside its playstation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms.traditional computers -

politics,"kennedy's cautious optimism charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election. in his 22 years in the commons, he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and, he might say, the uk's political and electoral system. but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months' time. ""look, i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around,"" he said. he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort. and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the ""real"" opposition. but doesn't that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second? he is prepared to go this far: ""a clear conclusion has been reached, including by conservatives, that the conservatives are not going to win this election.

""the problem is that, geographically, the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain. ""we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain. and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain"". mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters. he insists his three headline commitments, to be financed from a 1 tax increase on those earning over 100,000 a year, will appeal right across the political spectrum. they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax, provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees. he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour. ""i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election,"" he said. under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims. ""we are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies"". ""that is a clear cut choice for people, one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others"". as to his own future, he is clear. if, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament ""on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us"". that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that, if the tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party. perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side.","he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour.mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters.""this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced"".charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.he is prepared to go this far: ""a clear conclusion has been reached, including by conservatives, that the conservatives are not going to win this election.""i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election,"" he said.if, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament ""on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us"".that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that, if the tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.""we are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies"".""therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election, given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win."

""foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,"" said mr nath, without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. anshuman magazine, managing director, of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was ""a big positive step."" however, chittabrata majumdar, general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu), said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india's own ""self reliance"". he said, ""no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone."" mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.","he said, ""no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.""india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100 foreign direct investment in its construction sector.the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100 will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments.mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.analysts say improving india's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too.previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market."

""people are online and playing together and that really points to the future,"" he said. several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during mr gates' speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements. although most of these affected largely us consumers, the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come. these included what mr gates called an ""ecosystem of technologies"", like sbc's iptv, a high-definition tv and digital video recorder that worked via broadband to give high-quality and fast tv. there were also other deals announced which meant that people could watch and control content over portable devices and mobile phones. ces features several more key speeches from major technology players, such as intel and hewlett packard, as well as parallel conference sessions on gaming, storage, broadband and the future of digital music. about 50,000 new products will be unleashed at the tech-fest, which is the largest yet. consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by ces organisers the cea on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. that trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11 again in 2005.","he highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices ""seamless"".mr gates said that a lot of work had been done in the last year to sort out usability and compatibility issues between devices to make it easier to share content.several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during mr gates' speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements.bill gates has opened the consumer electronics show (ces) in las vegas, saying that gadgets are working together more to help people manage multimedia content around the home and on the move.""it is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference,"" he said.mr gates said the pc, like microsoft's media centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device.the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies will all be on show over the three days.that trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11 again in 2005.mr gates made no announcement about the next generation xbox games console, which many gadget lovers had been hoping for.the game, which makes use of the xbox live online games service, has sold 6.23 million copies since its release."
tech,"remote control rifle range debuts soon you could go hunting via the net. a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs. for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare texas ranch. the live-shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet. john underwood, the man behind the live-shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site. ""we were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said 'if you just had a gun for that'. a little light bulb went off in my head,"" mr underwood told the reuters news agency. a year's work and 10,000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle. mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig. each remote hunting session will cost 150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work. species that can be shot will include barbary, corsican and mouflon sheep, blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. already the live-shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for 5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. for further fees, users can get the target they shot and a dvd recording of their session. handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas. in a statement the rspca said it had ""grave concerns"" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle. ""we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a 'clean kill', something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport,"" it said. ""animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily,"" said the statement. mike berger, wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. he said state laws on hunting only covered ""regulated animals"" such as native deer and bird species. as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt ""unregulated"" imported animals and wild pigs. mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.","mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals.mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas.john underwood, the man behind the live-shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site.already the live-shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for 5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session.for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare texas ranch.as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt ""unregulated"" imported animals and wild pigs.a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs.in a statement the rspca said it had ""grave concerns"" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle.mike berger, wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting."

politics,"at a glance: tory health checks the uk' opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. all people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical. tuberculosis, hepatitis b and hiv. a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. all other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis. people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk, or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. they would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for. people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb. under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv. the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health. however, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases. they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by 25 over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. they also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. they say the plans will protect access to the nhs. applicants will be tested in their home country. only asylum seekers will be tested in the uk once their refugee status is established. home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries. recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at heathrow airport and 10,000 at gatwick. from those tests, about 100 infectious cases of tb were found. the tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. the party has looked at the way the system is operated in australia, canada and new zealand. the tory proposals are ""quite closely modelled"" on the new zealand system. labour claims the policy is little more than a ""desperate attempt to catch up with labour's five-year plan"" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. the liberal democrats have warned labour and the tories they were ""in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it"".","if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate.people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching.people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk, or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs.home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries.the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health.under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv.children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb.here's a guide to the plan: people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu.a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down.this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance.those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk.they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by 25 over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas."

sport,"england 17-18 france england suffered an eighth defeat in 11 tests as scrum-half dimitri yachvili booted france to victory at twickenham. two converted tries from olly barkley and josh lewsey helped the world champions to a 17-6 half-time lead. but charlie hodgson and barkley missed six penalties between them, while yachvili landed six for france to put the visitors in front. england could have won the game with three minutes left, but hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. it was a dismal defeat for england, coming hard on the heels of an opening six nations loss in wales. they should have put the game well beyond france's reach, but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. a scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against wales and scotland respectively. hodgson had an early opportunity to settle english nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. but a probing kick from france centre damien traille saw mark cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle, yachvili giving france the lead with a kick from wide out. france twice turned over england ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum, one ben kay charge apart. a spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until england refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out. but england made the breakthrough after 19 minutes, when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. jamie noon took a short pass from barkley and ran a good angle to plough through yann delaigue's flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts. hodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several french infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. the fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after france full-back pepito elhorga, scragged by lewsey, threw the ball into touch. barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close, but by then england had scored a second converted try. after a series of phases lock danny grewcock ran hard at the french defence and off-loaded out of sylvain marconnet's tackle to lewsey. the industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker sebastien bruno to sprint over. after a dire opening to the second half, france threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation, wing jimmy marlu having already departed injured. yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes. and when lewis moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half's unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. and after seeing another attempt drop just short, yachvili put france ahead with his sixth penalty with 11 minutes left. england sent on ben cohen and matt dawson, and after barkley's kick saw christophe dominici take the ball over his own line, the stage was set for a victory platform. but even after a poor scrummage, hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. england threw everything at the french in the final frantic moments, but the visitors held on for their first win at twickenham since 1997. j robinson (capt);

tech,"nintendo ds makes its euro debut nintendo's ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe. many stores around the uk opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. the two-screen clamshell gadget costs 99 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch, some featuring well-known characters such as super mario and rayman. the ds spearheads nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market. since going on sale in japan and the us at the end of 2004, nintendo has sold almost 4m ds consoles. part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendo's gameboy advance handheld. games for the ds are expected to cost between 19 and 29. about 130 games for the ds are in development. as well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. a ""download play"" option means ds owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. other ds owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. five virgin megastores and 150 game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy a ds. ""we know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day,"" said robert quinn, game's uk sales director. but nintendo will only have sole control of europe's handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console. although nintendo is aiming for younger players and the psp is more for older gamers, it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. sony's psp represents a real threat to nintendo because of the huge number of playstation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. the psp uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. when it goes on sale the psp is likely to cost between 130 and 200.","nintendo's ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe.about 130 games for the ds are in development.games for the ds are expected to cost between 19 and 29.a ""download play"" option means ds owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game.the ds spearheads nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendo's gameboy advance handheld.five virgin megastores and 150 game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy a ds.as well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless."

""we also confronted operating challenges with our jaguar brand and high industry marketing costs,"" he added. but ford declined to provide guidance for first quarter 2005. it will do so at a presentation in new york on 26 january. in addition, the company said 2004 net income was affected by a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge taken to reduce the value of a receivable owed to ford by visteon, a former subsidiary. recent new models introduced by ford include the ford five hundred and mercury montego sedans, the ford freestyle crossover, the ford mustang, the land rover lr3 discovery, and volvo s40 and v50 in north america and europe. total company vehicle unit sales in 2004 were 6,798,000, an increase of 62,000 units from 2003. fourth-quarter vehicle unit sales totalled 1,751,000, a decline of 133,000 units. for the full year, ford's worldwide automotive division earned a pre-tax profit of 850m, a 697m improvement from 153m a year ago.","in the fourth quarter alone ford reported net income of 104m, compared with a loss of 793m a year ago.ford, the us car company, reported higher fourth quarter and full-year profits on thursday boosted by a buoyant period for its car loans unit.though car and truck loan profits saved the day, ford's auto unit made a pre-tax loss of 470m in the fourth quarter (compared to a profit of 13m in the year-ago period) and its us sales dipped 3.8 .fourth quarter turnover was 44.7bn, compared to 45.9bn a year ago.total company vehicle unit sales in 2004 were 6,798,000, an increase of 62,000 units from 2003.recent new models introduced by ford include the ford five hundred and mercury montego sedans, the ford freestyle crossover, the ford mustang, the land rover lr3 discovery, and volvo s40 and v50 in north america and europe.in addition, the company said 2004 net income was affected by a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge taken to reduce the value of a receivable owed to ford by visteon, a former subsidiary.but ford declined to provide guidance for first quarter 2005."

sport,"o'sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential. ireland coach eddie o'sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's six nations championship. he decreed after the 2003 world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. that became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. it may have annoyed his scottish, and in particularly welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league. we will say nothing of mike ruddock ''poaching'' eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday. but, like o'sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. the irfu has thrown their weight behind o'sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of o'sullivan's squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season's campaign. but i doubt whether o'sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. he is not that sort of person. however, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit england, wales and france squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. a first grand slam since karl mullen's led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed. but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman. under the burden of great expectations, ireland have crumpled. take the triple crown-winning side of 1985 under mick doyle. they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam, only the second in ireland's history. what happened in 1986? whitewashed. you see, ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized. then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. it is the nature of the beast. but o'sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. after their first triple crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. o'sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. he has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed. ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.","but, like o'sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it.but o'sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season.ireland coach eddie o'sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's six nations championship.already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season.he has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed.take the triple crown-winning side of 1985 under mick doyle.ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.o'sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come.after their first triple crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder.that became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season.however, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit england, wales and france squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight.under the burden of great expectations, ireland have crumpled."
entertainment,"da vinci code is 'lousy history' the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is 'laughable', a clergyman has said. the da vinci code claims jesus was not crucified, but married mary magdalene and died a normal death. it claims this was later covered up by the church. the bishop of durham, the rt rev dr tom wright, described the novel as a ""great thriller"" but ""lousy history"". the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. despite enjoying dan brown's conspiracy theory, the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims. writing his christmas message in the northern echo, the bishop said: ""conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. ""dan brown is the best writer i've come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable."" a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus' life was true, according to the bishop. ""the evidence for jesus and the origins of christianity is astonishingly good,"" he said. ""we have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the new testament than we have for the main classical authors like cicero, virgil and tacitus. ""historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don't fit the world of later legend."" brown's book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the uk and us. the da vinci code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. the book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks.","despite enjoying dan brown's conspiracy theory, the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus' life was true, according to the bishop.the da vinci code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims.the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is 'laughable', a clergyman has said.the book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks.brown's book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the uk and us."
tech,"bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush. the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers, but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp. the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney failed. by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. on 21 october, the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. mike prettejohn, president of netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however, simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. akamai declined to comment, saying it could not talk about customer websites.","since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it.surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush.by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems.netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney failed.on 21 october, the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors.the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us.the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning."
tech,"apple mac mini gets warm welcome the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans, industry experts and pc users. the release of the tiny, low-cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers. they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer. ""it's the bravest move they have made yet,"" said jonny evans, news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost, small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success. he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware. ""it's deeply affordable,"" he said. ""plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems."" already, he said, pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple's store and the show struggled to cope with demand. according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs' speech suffered lengthy response times. the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline. ""i think fundamentally it's a good idea because it's cheap even for a pc,"" said nick ross, deputy labs editor at pc pro. apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans, he said. ""i think people expect it just to work now and really it should,"" hesaid. the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said. ""for browsing the web, e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it's going to be absolutely adequate,"" said mr ross. ian fogg, broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research, agreed that the mac mini could be very popular. ""apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac,"" he said. before now, he said, apple has been seen as a premium brand. but, he said, the mac mini changed that perception. ""it's a particularly good price when you see that it's apple that is doing it,"" he said. apple expects the mac mini to sell for 339 in the uk and 499 in the us. adding extras such as a larger hard drive, more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. it will go on sale from 22 january. ""for consumers interested in style, design and small size - which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in - it's a natural next step,"" said mr fogg. apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at, said mr fogg, who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction. his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers, other than ipod owners, would find using the machine. he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor. ""they'd be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost,"" he said. those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine. there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals, such as display, keyboard and mouse. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said mr fogg. ""the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet,"" he said. ""it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage."" said mr fogg: ""it's very much a computer."" one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage, vice-president of research at analysts gartner. he said: ""i don't think it changes the world."" although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many pcs. also, he said, it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer. ""the pc world is a pile-em-high, sell-em-cheap market,"" he said, ""and all of them are pretty interchangeable."" ""since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long, slow decline,"" he said. ""every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again,"" said mr gammage. the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.","but, he said, the mac mini changed that perception.""the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet,"" he said.the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at, said mr fogg, who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction.the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said.""apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac,"" he said.apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans, he said.said mr fogg: ""it's very much a computer.""""they'd be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost,"" he said.he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said mr fogg.mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers.before now, he said, apple has been seen as a premium brand.""it's a particularly good price when you see that it's apple that is doing it,"" he said.the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans, industry experts and pc users.apple expects the mac mini to sell for 339 in the uk and 499 in the us.although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many pcs.""it's deeply affordable,"" he said."
tech,"games 'deserve a place in class' computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers. academics from the institute of education at london university found that ""games literacy"" was a key skill for youngsters. as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say. pupils should also be able to create their own games, they say. ""like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,"" said project manager caroline pelletier. ""games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,"" she said. the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. ""without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be, they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity,"" said research fellow diane carr. the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. sixth-form teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, tv and popular music at the a-level course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge. for parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy. dr andrew burn, associate director of the institute of education's centre for the study of children, youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents. ""games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do,"" he said. ""but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games."" the games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. ""at a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural, social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently,"" said roger bennett, director general of the entertainment and leisure software publishers association. ""this report is further evidence, if it were needed, about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming. they have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career."" the three-year research project, which is being presented at a seminar on tuesday in london, was partly funded by the department of trade and industry.","""like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,"" said project manager caroline pelletier.the games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children.computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them.""games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,"" she said.the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning.as well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say.for parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy."
politics,"concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england's secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report. the government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. some are worried it could be scuppered if, as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested, gcses and a-levels stay. sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday. ""it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,"" said the chairman of the commons education select committee, labour mp barry sheerman. his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. ""we must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,"" he wrote in the times educational supplement. ""it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak."" the qualifications and curriculum authority (qca) has also told the government not to ""compromise"". the qca said the potential ""step-change in participation and attainment"" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. ""any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,"" said its chairman, sir anthony greener. it is a sign of the qca's concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently. but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills. they may be content if it does not ""close too many doors"" in writing - whatever spin is put on it. the chief inspector of schools, david bell, also said recently that gcses and a-levels should go. ""one of the reasons why i'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,"" he said. ""if we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity."" universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the cbi, which complains of a lack of skills. in an attempt to address this, the tomlinson plan is for tests in ""functional"" maths and literacy - decidedly not gcses. it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, professor chris woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a ""massive upheaval"". the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.","but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday.he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week.final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england's secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report.""it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,"" said the chairman of the commons education select committee, labour mp barry sheerman.his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.the qualifications and curriculum authority (qca) has also told the government not to ""compromise"".sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week.it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score.but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills.the chief inspector of schools, david bell, also said recently that gcses and a-levels should go."

politics,"peace demo appeal rejected peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an anti-war demonstration days after the start of the iraq war. they had appealed against a high court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near raf fairford, glos, in 2003. the police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. sitting on wednesday, three appeal court judges dismissed both appeals. they were challenging decisions by two judges in the high court in february this year. it followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to raf fairford and forced to return to london under police escort. the demonstrators appealed against a finding by lord justice may and mr justice harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away. the police were urging lord chief justice and lord justices clarke and rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors' human rights by detaining them in the coaches. craig mackey, assistant chief constable of gloucestershire police, said: ""we have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence."" he said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour, a smoke bomb and five shields.

""it's not surprising gordon brown told him: 'there's nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.'"" mr howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said mr clarke. he said: ""the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making."" the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. tory mp patrick mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.","but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.on thursday, mr howard told bbc radio 4's today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said mr clarke.metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted.home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.mr howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders.he said: ""the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making.""mr howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: ""it is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."""
business,"world leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). for five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos. the organisers of the brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. however, many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well. ""global warming"" features particularly high. wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. davos itself is in deep frost. the snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20c and less. ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme. ""taking responsibility for tough choices"" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. one thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran, iraq and china are set to dominate discussions. pointedly, only one senior official from president bush's new administration is scheduled to attend. the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos. ukraine's new president, viktor yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power. the european union's top leaders, among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso, will be here too. mr blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by french president jacques chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a ""special message"" two hours before mr blair speaks. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader, mahmoud abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes shimon peres. davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal. mr blair's appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown, who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation. microsoft founder bill gates, the world's richest man and a regular at davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria, mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. on tuesday, mr gates pledged 750m ( 400m) of his own money to support the cause. mr gates' company, software giant microsoft, also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux, which threaten microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops. mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil's president lula da silva. the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux. at davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.","more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef).but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme.the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos.mr gates' company, software giant microsoft, also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux, which threaten microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops.however, many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well.uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting.davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal.microsoft founder bill gates, the world's richest man and a regular at davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either.the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos.davos itself is in deep frost.mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil's president lula da silva.having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria, mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases.at davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart."

""far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" his party leader, michael howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending.

tech,"sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch. the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. the latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed, massively entertaining and ooze flair. sports broadcaster espn, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent, meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form. it was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters, with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18,000 virtual signatures. many of those clicking to complain were already rankled, for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal, controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america 191;s national football league (nfl). so, will the sega - espn range be missed? a key reason for answering ""yes"" is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste, and having some options available always proves hugely handy. online soccer fans will testify to that, between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer 4. on the same note, the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. taking hockey and basketball as examples, both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. they also both look awesome, with the sega espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front. in terms of gameplay, i marginally preferred ea's nba live 2005 for basketball, and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by espn's nhl 2k5. the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea's future titles. the front-end decoration of ea's games has become something of an art-form in itself, loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable, and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways. what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv. they are neat and excellent-value games in their current form, and combining them with ea's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.","but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent, meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form.on the same note, the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements.the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans.sports broadcaster espn, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price.so, will the sega - espn range be missed?they also both look awesome, with the sega espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years.perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea's future titles."

business,"business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business. lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend. but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce, which stands beside the opera house, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern english towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? like northern england and industrial scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. beck-crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres, about 20 miles from lille. the company has not laid off a worker since 1945. it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in europe these days. director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in china and india. ""in our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged european union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,"" he says. it isn't just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. but at least there is still a steel industry. coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. new business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference. that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu, says frederic sawicki, a politics lecturer at the university of lille. ""in the region today the unemployment rate is 12 , in some areas it is 15 . they don't see what europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" he says. which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. much of that trade passes through the world's largest port, rotterdam, in holland, home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec. its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed, but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer. boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home. ""in the us growth is something like 6 , in china they are estimating 15 , and in the eu it is more or less 1 ,"" he says. mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand. he much preferred the old currencies of europe, which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. in germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2 . in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years. with germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. if germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. however, at one factory near the dutch border things are changing. the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary. factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity ""by nearly 30 "". but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china. the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says helmut schneider, director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university. ""labour is too costly in germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,"" he says. the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.","in germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment.but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china.boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home.if germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be.""in the us growth is something like 6 , in china they are estimating 15 , and in the eu it is more or less 1 ,"" he says.which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here.it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in europe these days.as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.they don't see what europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" he says.""labour is too costly in germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu, says frederic sawicki, a politics lecturer at the university of lille.the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world.with germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem.director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in china and india.new business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years."

business,"eu aiming to fuel development aid european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals, including a tax on jet fuel, to boost development aid for poorer nations. the policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised, the eu said. the world's richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7 of their annual gross national income by 2015. airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy. profits have been under pressure in the airline industry, with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 september terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer sars virus. things have picked up, but some european and us companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. at present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states. ""of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines?"" said ulrich schulte-strathaus, secretary general of the association of european airlines. ""our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs,"" he continued. the eu sought to allay the airlines' fears, stressing that thursday's meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. it added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel ""should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development"". any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the eu said. there is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the world's richest nations - from eu ministers. the issue of poverty in africa and south asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda, with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done. at their meeting in london, g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100 of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.","any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the eu said.it added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel ""should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development"".said ulrich schulte-strathaus, secretary general of the association of european airlines.european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals, including a tax on jet fuel, to boost development aid for poorer nations.at present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states.airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.there is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the world's richest nations - from eu ministers."

politics,"minimum wage increased to 5.05 the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced. adults must be paid at least 5.05 an hour, up from 4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid 4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a 6 rate. a further increase in the adult rate to 5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006. according to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"". ""we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact,"" said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing. unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"". ""for too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families,"" he said. ""too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay."" chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh, wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast. the government has not accepted the commission's recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate, but says it will look again at the rate later on. mr brown said: ""we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people, particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time."" the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage. the national minimum wage is currently set at 4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at 4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. a 3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt. the trade unions congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a 6 minimum wage by next year. but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october. and david frost, director of the british chambers of commerce, said: ""the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation. ""what employers are saying to us now is that it's at a level where it's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country."" the liberal democrats' economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage. ""it's not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too,"" he said. conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase. speaking on bbc radio 4's woman's hour, mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers. ""there are people on very low salaries, very low incomes indeed who really shouldn't be paying income tax,"" he said. it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below 12,000 a year, with say no tax on below 6,000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over 100,000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2 3rds of the us! perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60 more here than they do in the us. this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further. it's still not good enough! i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid 2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage! we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together. any increase is certainly welcome news. however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them: ""would you be happy to work for less than 5.05 an hour?"". thought not ... so then, don't expect others to either. i can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you? it's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn't go a miss either. br gt; this is good news. the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer. wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee's efforts. for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed. it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries, bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr! i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out. here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! we all remember michael howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. i think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and 5.05 is hardly a fortune. if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners! great keep at it tony, i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. we can't afford not to pay a decent wage. it's not a jobs at any price economy, goodbye sweatshops hello decency. the increase in minimum wage is a good thing. living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour. hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own. i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering portering etc - pay the minimum wage of 4.85 as the basic rate. someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages? who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow? this is definitely the right step in the right direction. it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. this is a million votes more. good strategy isn't it? although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks. i am quite prepared for a raft of 'bribes' to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards, they are playing us for the fools they think we are. this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. by increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. the extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. the jubilation felt by ""low-paid"" workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs. this will only lead to a reduction in jobs. why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india. blair say's the economy is ""strong and stable economy"" however consumer debt and the country's debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses, that will have no choice but to cut the workforce. the timing cannot be coincidental. this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such. andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'. i don't mind if it is. in our degraded democracy, elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. if my maths is right, a 35 hour week at 5.05 gives you an annual income just over 9,000 and raising it to 6 leaves it under 11,000. the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more. businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm. i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less. it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as 'sweat shop', but now we are told it is global competition. with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. the whole picture needs to be looked at. this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage. seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. when you can ""earn"" more from claiming than you can from work, there is no incentive. perhaps a step in the right direction. if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work. how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us. while i'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. as an employee for a small nursery, i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. if the rate rises to 6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees. the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go. i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80 of my costs are labour. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the ""lower status"" jobs. i know about this great idea - don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage. the ones who suffer are the employers. i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door? i don't believe in the minimum wage at all! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. now, before everyone thinks that i am some ""rich-kid"", i can assure you i am not. i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning 25 per week. i worked hard, went to college part time, got my a-levels and degree bettered myself. i now earn a 6 figure salary. i did that through hard work and getting off my backside. a minimum wage just makes people complacent. to ashley, of swindon: when you earned 25 per week, it was worth something. these days that 25 would need to be near to 60 to have the equivalent buying power. i might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages. ""in my day"" type arguments are a view that belong in the 'your day' - 20 years ago! as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get. i disagree with ashley, swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay. i have my gcse's a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages i should be getting, i should be on at least 3x what i'm getting but they can't afford it. we all work hard but the money is just not there. but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn't change it just to get more pay. as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional 5000 per year. these next rises will cost me more. i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. so no one really wins in the end. in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well. if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the 6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. think of us employers as well mr blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions. all workers should be entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement? it is good news for many asians living in uk. students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.","the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get.the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.a minimum wage just makes people complacent.although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.i don't believe in the minimum wage at all!this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage.hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage -

funny how he's gone quiet on that one!in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well.unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"".conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase.how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential.the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.a 3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt.i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering portering etc - pay the minimum wage of 4.85 as the basic rate.andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'.the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer.with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.we can't afford not to pay a decent wage.as an employee for a small nursery, i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum.but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october.its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid 2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you?i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers.in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour.the national minimum wage is currently set at 4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at 4.10 for those aged 18 to 21.if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!the liberal democrats' economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.i think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and 5.05 is hardly a fortune.i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.if the rate rises to 6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with.i have my gcse's a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages i should be getting, i should be on at least 3x what i'm getting but they can't afford it.in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low.great keep at it tony, i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with.businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.while i'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses.we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us."
tech,"blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow. these online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax's accounts of the us-led war, former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.com, launched last november. the blogging movement has been building up for many years. andrew nachison, director of the media center, a us-based think-tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. ""you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power, to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before,"" he says. ""and blogs were a key part of that transformation."" among them were blogs carrying picture messages, saying ""we are sorry"" for george w bush's victory and the responses from his supporters. mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, tv and radio. ""we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas,"" he told the bbc news website. ""but they followed the story, they didn't lead it."" some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs. others, like the french newspaper le monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. ""i don't think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. it is in transition, as society itself is in transition,"" says mr nachison. however, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper. ""the one-to-many road of traditional journalism, yes, it is threatened. and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,"" says mr nachison. ""the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what's acceptable for public consumption and what isn't, that's gone forever."" ""with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories."" it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger. but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. tools such as google's blogger, movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog. us research think-tank pew internet american life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months. but experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. ""we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other,"" said mr nachison. ""and there's going to be bad that comes with the good.""","mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, tv and radio.blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so-called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels.but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information.however, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.""and blogs were a key part of that transformation.""most blogs may have only a small readership, but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics.others, like the french newspaper le monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content.but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events.us research think-tank pew internet american life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, although less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months.web logs or blogs are everywhere, with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse,"" says mr nachison.it is in transition, as society itself is in transition,"" says mr nachison.tools such as google's blogger, movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog."
tech,"mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype? let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the mac mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired apple design. there is more to be said on the computer's size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer. inside that small box there is a g4 processor, a cd dvd player, a hard drive, some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. a dvd burner, wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. and if you do not have a monitor, keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also. it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under 400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - apple software. the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x, the operating system, as well as ilife 05, a suite of software which includes itunes, web browser safari, iphoto, garage band and idvd. i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x. of course, users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs. for people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer. ""it's a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses,"" said mark sparrow, technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine. he added: ""in essence, it's a laptop in a biscuit tin, minus the screen and the keyboard. ""the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick."" the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs. one user has already created a ""dock"" to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car. the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes, music, films and photos - partly due to its small, living room friendly design. but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at 80gb for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre. while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content. a media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small. most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not. but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses. so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing? graham barlow, editor of mac format, understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint. ""it's just a mac, but we should be very excited - it's revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs), looks (looks better than pcs), and the fact that it's the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market."" the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland, bulky boxes. there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards. but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft's media center software. but for the value the mac mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, apple is to be congratulated. let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.","another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse.so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing?but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses.there is more to be said on the computer's size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer.the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x, the operating system, as well as ilife 05, a suite of software which includes itunes, web browser safari, iphoto, garage band and idvd.the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland, bulky boxes.one user has already created a ""dock"" to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car.for people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not.let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.""it's just a mac, but we should be very excited - it's revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs), looks (looks better than pcs), and the fact that it's the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market.""let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the mac mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired apple design.but for the value the mac mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, apple is to be congratulated.a media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small."

""it's an important game but we've just the one full session. it's the same for everyone but we need to manage it. ""if five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,"" he told bbc sport. unless the authorities agree to make changes, saint-andre believes england's national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals.

tech,"domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif. domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so, for example, website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'. but the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system, said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, mr dyer said. ""although the idn problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,"" said mr dyer. ""it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,"" he added. there are solutions. for instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. another solution, to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said. centr, the council of european national top level domain registries, agrees. ""a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement.","a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system, said mr dyer.but the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, mr dyer said.the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'.a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif.so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used.but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily.the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force."

business,"economy 'strong' in election year uk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report. optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at bdo stoy hayward. the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may. the bdo optimism index - a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to 102.5, from 102.2 in october. the rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity. the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, bdo said. its bdo's output index - which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for january, implying gdp growth at 2.9 in the second quarter of 2005. however, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in january from 108.0 in october last year. ""the uk is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,"" said peter hemington, partner at bdo stoy hayward.

tech,"format wars could 'confuse users' technology firms sony, philips, matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video. the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy. currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"". the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium. the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple. ""in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,"" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. ""the difference is that it is very fragmented,"" he said. ""it's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race"" mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft's ""plays for sure"" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come. shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple's itunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. ""although itunes has been hugely successful, apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods,"" she said. she said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. ""it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,"" she said, ""and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest."" ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. ""people want portability,"" she said, ""and with peer-to-peer they have 100 portability."" cory doctorow, european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims. ""not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. ""the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version, the auto version, the american and uk version, the ringtone version, and so on.""","instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats.he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy.shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers.""not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said.in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"".ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.""in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,"" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying.the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft.the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought."

business,"japanese mogul arrested for fraud one of japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data. yoshiaki tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. his is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in japan over business scandals. he was taken away in a van outside one of his prince hotels in tokyo. there was a time when mr tsutsumi seemed untouchable. inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. he used his wealth and influence to bring the winter olympic games to nagano in 1998. but last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of seibu railways, one of his companies. under japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80 owned by its 10 largest shareholders. now mr tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. seibu railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid. mr tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in japanese companies. his determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. the illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as japan rebuilt after world war ii, he has described the demands his father made. ""i felt enormous pressure when i dined with him and it was nothing but pain,"" tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. ""he scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. he didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury."" there have been corporate governance issues at some other japanese companies too. last year, twelve managers from mitsubishi motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from japan's troubled ufj bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.","but last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of seibu railways, one of his companies.mr tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in japanese companies.there was a time when mr tsutsumi seemed untouchable.yoshiaki tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team.his is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in japan over business scandals.one of japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.""i felt enormous pressure when i dined with him and it was nothing but pain,"" tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987.he was taken away in a van outside one of his prince hotels in tokyo."

tech,"gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel, apple, and ibm among others to promote recycling. the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005. but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the us environmental protection agency (epa). of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices, one of the fastest growing markets in technology. the consumer electronics association (cea) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than 125.73 billion (nearly 68 billion). ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. the online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential. ""we really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good,"" ebay's david stern told the bbc news website. ""we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment."" but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months, adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. yet, only 15 are actually recycled. this year, a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile, according to a deloitte report. schemes in the us, like ripmobile, could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. the initiative, which was also launched at ces, rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones. ""this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games,"" said seth heine from ripmobile. one group of students collected 1,000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes ""learned behaviour"". europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust ""end of life"" programmes, although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free. ""there is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free,"" intel's allen wilson told the bbc news website. ""there is still low-level awareness right now, but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in europe."" a european union (eu) directive, weee (waste electronic and electrical equipment), comes into effect in august. it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006. but it is not just about recycling either. the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. the biggest culprit, according to the epa, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed ""energy vampires"". they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones, pdas (personal digital assistants), digital cameras, camcorders, and digital music players. although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. on 1 january, new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct. but at ces, the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo, meaning they are about 35 more efficient. the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers' adaptors are being brought on board. most are made in china. about two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the us alone. the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22 of power supplies on the market. ""we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply,"" the epa's andrew fanara said. initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes, said the epa.","but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the us environmental protection agency (epa).initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes, said the epa.but at ces, the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters.the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too.the consumer electronics association (cea) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than 125.73 billion (nearly 68 billion).the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005.but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances.although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget.the biggest culprit, according to the epa, is the innocuous power adaptor, nicknamed ""energy vampires"".at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month, several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment.""we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi-tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi-tech, efficient power supply,"" the epa's andrew fanara said.elements like chromium, lead, and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006.about two billion are shipped global every year, and about three billion are in use in the us alone.ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them.the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22 of power supplies on the market.""there is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free,"" intel's allen wilson told the bbc news website.mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes ""learned behaviour""."

business,"ukraine revisits state sell-offs ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration. the new president, viktor yushchenko, has said a ""limited"" list of companies is being drawn up. but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. more than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled. ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed. ""we will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands."" a day earlier, mr yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. the list ""will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion"", he said. an open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in ukraine, said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit. but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia, mr hensel said. as a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. ""they're aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within ukraine,"" he said. ""they don't want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set."" foreign investment in ukraine, at about 40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-soviet states. mr yushchenko became president after two elections in december, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests. his opponent, viktor yanukovich, still has huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland. mr yushchenko's administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-president leonid kuchma, of corruption. the privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk, mr kuchma's son-in-law, for 800m ( 424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. the mill, krivorizhstal, is one of the world's most profitable. ""we say krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,"" mr yushchenko told an investors' conference in kiev. one of the jilted bidders, netherlands-based group lnm, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market. ""if the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,"" a spokesman told bbc news. a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the economist intelligence unit's mr hensel. but he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. ""that way, mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,"" he told bbc news.","the new president, viktor yushchenko, has said a ""limited"" list of companies is being drawn up.""we say krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,"" mr yushchenko told an investors' conference in kiev.an open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in ukraine, said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit.but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia, mr hensel said.a day earlier, mr yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms.""that way, mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,"" he told bbc news.ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.the list ""will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion"", he said.the privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk, mr kuchma's son-in-law, for 800m ( 424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups.a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the economist intelligence unit's mr hensel."

business,"us ahold suppliers face charges us prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping dutch retailer ahold inflate earnings by more than 800m ( 428m). the charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies, alleging they created false accounts. ahold hit the headlines in february 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its us subsidiary foodservice. three former ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges. ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at foodservice, improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities. the nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to ahold, are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores. food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. the suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed ahold to inflate its earnings. us attorney david kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. he added that there may be more court actions in the future. ""i don't want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved,"" he said. among those facing charges are john nettle, a former employee of general mills; mark bailin of rymer international seafood; tim daly of michael foods and kenneth bowman, who worked as an independent contractor for total foods. others include michael hannigan of sugar foods; peter marion of maritime seafood processors and first choice foods; gordon redgate of commodity manager and private label distribution; bruce robinson of basic american foods and michael rogers, formerly of tyson foods. pasquale d'amuro of the fbi called the nine vendors the key ingredients in ""the process of cooking the books"" at ahold. at the time of the scandal, ahold was seen by many as europe's enron. ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across europe. it was less severe than many had envisaged, however, and since then ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence. ahold is the world's fourth-largest supermarket chain. its other us businesses include stop shop, and giant food.","us prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping dutch retailer ahold inflate earnings by more than 800m ( 428m).the nine now charged, who worked as suppliers to ahold, are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores.the suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid, providing auditors with signed letters that allowed ahold to inflate its earnings.ahold is the world's fourth-largest supermarket chain.ahold hit the headlines in february 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its us subsidiary foodservice.it was less severe than many had envisaged, however, and since then ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence.at the time of the scandal, ahold was seen by many as europe's enron.pasquale d'amuro of the fbi called the nine vendors the key ingredients in ""the process of cooking the books"" at ahold."
tech,"camera phones are 'must-haves' four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner. globally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104 . the report predicts that nearly 70 of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly ""must-have"" buy. in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. by 2008, according to gartner, 95 of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them. camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages. mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips. images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists. the exhibition, fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers david bailey, rankin and nan goldin, and artists sir peter blake, tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel, samsung, the uk's foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy's information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits. according to recent figures, sony ericsson's profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60 of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras, it said.","the report predicts that nearly 70 of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008.image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving.by 2008, according to gartner, 95 of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images.the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels.but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits.in europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images.four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner.images from camera phones have even made it into the art world.but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras.camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services).consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera.realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages."

business,"qwest may spark mci bidding war us phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war. mci accepted a 6.75bn ( 3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant verizon on monday, rejecting a higher offer from qwest. qwest chairman richard notebaert sent a letter to mci's board on thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining verizon's bid. formerly known as worldcom, mci is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. snapping up mci would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. shares of mci were up more than 4 in electronic trading after the close of new york markets. qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth 8bn. ""we would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire mci,"" the letter from qwest said. verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues mci. verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and 1.50 in cash for each mci share, as well as offering special dividends of 4.50 a share. both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. as well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than verizon's. the takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month, sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at t for about 16bn. there may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as mci only emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. verizon is far bigger than qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. also, mci, while trading under the name worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in us history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an 11bn fraud. qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the securities and exchange commission 250m in october to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep wall street happy.","qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth 8bn.us phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.mci accepted a 6.75bn ( 3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant verizon on monday, rejecting a higher offer from qwest.""we would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire mci,"" the letter from qwest said.verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues mci.formerly known as worldcom, mci is a long-distance and corporate phone firm.verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and 1.50 in cash for each mci share, as well as offering special dividends of 4.50 a share.qwest chairman richard notebaert sent a letter to mci's board on thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining verizon's bid."

tech,"mobile networks seek turbo boost third-generation mobile (3g) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services. that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm, siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks. ""high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers. ""while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said dr alastair brydon, author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements. ""the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma 3g ,"" he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised (ev-do). us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are ""expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,"" said oliver valente, sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. as part of 3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, sprint will spend around 1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies, nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2, the uk-based operator with services in the uk, ireland and germany, has opted for technology based on hsdpa. using technology from lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa, using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson. siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but christoph caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: ""by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by 3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - much faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren't, those lucrative ""power users"", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.","the speeds offered by 3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences.the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now.using technology from lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps.but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised (ev-do).at 3gsm, siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data.the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second -

""the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" ukip spokesman mark croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston's reported views had been presented as ukip policy, which they were not.","damian hockney said ex-chatshow host mr kilroy-silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a eurosceptic party.sources close to mr hockney said around eight other members of london ukip were also planning to jump ship.on the suspension of mr houston, ukip said those who selected him knew nothing of his views.a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly.he said mr kilroy-silk had made him deputy party leader of veritas, latin for truth.mr hockney meanwhile told the bbc: ""i believe that robert kilroy-silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the uk independence party."""

politics,"mps to debate 'euthanasia laws' mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia ""by the back door"". the bill would give legal force to ""living wills"", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. but christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate. ministers insist the mental capacity bill - for england and wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life. the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors. critics fear it could allow ""killing by omission"" through withdrawing treatment. an amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith. ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment. mps could vote on it later on tuesday, during the bill's report stage debate. the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords, before becoming law. the christian medical fellowship (cmf) and lawyers' christian fellowship (lcf) said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the ""back door"". peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory, not legally binding. ""cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take,"" he said. the lcf's andrea williams said there were ""too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors"". ex-labour minister frank field told bbc two's newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to ""do away"" with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets. constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting 750,000 people with dementia needed updating. mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened, not changed. ""we are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,"" he said. ""doctors are saying they want more clarity. patients are saying they want more clarity."" the making decisions alliance, which includes the alzheimer's society, age concern, mencap and the national autistic society, said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. ""it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity,"" the alliance said in a statement. the british medical association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty. she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.","the bill would give legal force to ""living wills"", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated.the christian medical fellowship (cmf) and lawyers' christian fellowship (lcf) said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the ""back door"".it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf, which could be challenged by doctors.the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment.""we are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,"" he said.mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia ""by the back door"".the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise.""it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity,"" the alliance said in a statement.ministers insist the mental capacity bill - for england and wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.the british medical association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others.an amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith."

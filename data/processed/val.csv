tech,"'brainwave' cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer. four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. ""the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,"" said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed. brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. ""the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,"" said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.","although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated.a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes.previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain.the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively.",positive,0.9994450211524963

yeah right. i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out. like every track robbie has released as a single, it's a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before. give us a break...!!! best song in 25 years, you must be joking. its good if you like that sort of thing, but really! listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work. had not heard it for a while. i love robs voice, the lyrics and tune. perfection! as usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for ""the greatest"". there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. it's not exactly groundbreaking. presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low... i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!! what about the specials - ghost town, the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone... happy mondays - kinky afro, mcalmont butler - yes, joy division - love will tear us apart... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish. angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. it's musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like mr williams himself. this result isn't very surprising though, the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music! best of the last 25 years? maybe. cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. not much competition in the last 25 years after all. it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years??? there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty. rubbish! who voted it for it to be included in any list? i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years. how depressing and just when we thought manufactured 'pop' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from? while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. then again, well done robbie, good show. you've got to be kidding. angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits. i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years! right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good! i'm happy for robbie himself though! best song in the last 25 years? what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards. so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today, for me it's proof that music and democracy just don't mix. still, at least it wasn't will young... oh it's all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent! i hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with! i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie. i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song. it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush. angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups. robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think. yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning. i've always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as ""classic"" songwriting. it's 'orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer's afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisss angels, best song? you are kidding, right? last five years i might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century. no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from???? compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? i mean, will young? come on. what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close. what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"". why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up. why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! i think not, i didn't realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!! people have such short memories! a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here. the great british public at work again. it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. granted, it's not too bad, either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular ""how soon is now?"") or anything from the stone roses' first album? nope. no, because i'm not female and i'm not 10! ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! the shortlist wasn't great but him winning it is a joke! predictable and laughable. the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years. i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list. have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division? a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will. no doubt about it. there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song. it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds, the beatles and nick drake have done for music today. yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner. i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music. the best song of the past 25 years? really? come on, this is surely a joke? no? i think i need a long lie down... it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it's confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- lt;( no offence robbie, but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music, and a further nail in the coffin! i think robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn't deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey, another one bites the dust!! obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it. if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record. a sad day for music it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. it's a good all-rounder. just like robbie. best song in 25 years? since 1980? i'm confused. ""angels"" isn't a bad song. it's a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it's regressive. bland even. i suppose it's just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become. granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition. the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic! also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him! best song of the last 25 years? what a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside, at least it wasn't bohemian rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful. angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!! don't get me wrong, i'm not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners. it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels, robbie williams may well not be where he is now, and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob. i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'. what about britpop? blur, oasis, suede, pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular? i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters, i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near u2's new record, neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit. no surprise really, it's voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music? personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard! it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come. it's an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise ! the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn't end up in the hands of will young though. although it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody, nothing compares 2 u, etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent. although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that's all it means!","angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.best song of the last 25 years?best song in the last 25 years?i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years!robbie williams' angels was named the best song of the past 25 years.it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???best song in 25 years?although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years?that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!!the best song of the past 25 years?i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year?if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble.the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!!but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!booo hisss angels, best song?i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!!while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.best song in 25 years, you must be joking.only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years.there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song.i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song.angels is a fantastic song.yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.""angels"" isn't a bad song.personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!best of the last 25 years?i am a huge robbie fan and love that song.think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels.there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.williams' track beat songs by will young, queen, kate bush and joy division in a vote by bbc radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the uk music industry ceremony.but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.a sad day for music it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years.it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.mcfly won the best pop act prize, and gwen stefani picked up the best international female artist award.i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years!the flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards.what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close.it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song.it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.little britain comedy duo matt lucas and david walliams presented the best song prize to robbie williams dressed as his former take that colleagues gary barlow and howard donald, leading him to quip he was ""always the talented man of the band"".some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.the song is overplayed and oversentimental.granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good!there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win!much better songs and more timeless.phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote?also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!the us band, who opened the show with take your mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.franz ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best british group, an award they dedicated to late dj john peel.it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.keane won best british album and breakthrough act.if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.natasha bedingfield - in the running for best british female and best pop act - performed with her brother daniel for the first time at wednesday's event.a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.soppy rubbish at best.it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division.that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"".it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much.the song makes me calm and serene and happy.the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic!will young won the best single prize for your game.robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels.if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people.viewers of digital music tv channel mtv base voted stone the winner in the best urban act category.i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.robbie was a deserved winner.why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?just like robbie.after beating amy winehouse, jamelia, natasha bedingfield and pj harvey to the best british female prize, joss stone said: ""i don't know what to say.glasgow group franz ferdinand won two prizes, as did keane and joss stone, who was voted best urban act by digital tv viewers.best british male artist winner mike skinner - aka the streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit dry your eyes at the ceremony.whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out).then again, well done robbie, good show.but they missed out on best british live act, which went to muse.whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example.",positive,0.8886521458625793

""i think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates,"" mr vishwanathan said. last month the chairman of the commission for racial equality (cre) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances. a cre spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in parliament.

sport,"a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most. well, at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish, and not just with eddie o'sullivan's triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to o'sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100 record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa, ireland finsihed the year on a high. the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965. that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. but the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in o'sullivan's mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me, the try of the championship. o'sullivan's career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that, but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand. there can be no doubt that ireland's representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. in brian o'driscoll and paul o'connell, ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon d'arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament. on the provincial front, leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody's guess. ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game. ulster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side, irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban. that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools' cup success since 1977. the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character, doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey, coleraine's jonathan hutchinson, and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle.","while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight

""i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician,"" he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat. the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders, saying: ""i'm sorry. it is a dilemma, but there is only one choice."" but mr howard said: ""we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life."" he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared ""internment without trial creates martyrs"" and could be ""a very effective recruiting sergeant"" for terrorists"". his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to ""enter into constructive discussions"" with his party to find a ""better way forward"". controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail. home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man, known only as c, certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday, the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""it's a matter of principle for us that we can't have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals."" the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions.

tech,"ban hits half-life 2 pirates hard about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game. game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of half-life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version. half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run. in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. ""the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half-life 2,"" read the statement. valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20,000 represented. one effect of steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten. even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts. valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts. some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account. some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve's anti-piracy actions. in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. the company said: ""the hack came from the 'community' as do they all."" it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys. rob fahey, editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz, said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system. before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. ""but with this, valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life 2,"" he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. ""it's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games,"" he said. this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.","in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false.before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played.game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version.half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online.about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game.unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts.if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems.authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.",negative,0.9227575659751892

tech,"screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data. ""we've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,"" said malte pollmann, spokesman for lycos europe. ""in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users,"" he said, ""but now we are going to go one step further.""

""every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,"" he said, ""about one mp3 file."" but, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back, said mr pollmann. ""that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing,"" he said. the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer. typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop. to limit the chance of mistakes being made, lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said mr pollmann. sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85 . users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver. while working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on 1 december and before now has only been trialled in sweden. despite the soft launch, mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days.

politics,"brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time, tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other. this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists: ""i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose."" and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election. so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well, not really, as it happens. and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared: ""i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers"" before catching himself on and quickly adding: ""in so far as i read them of course."" he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men. as far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations. either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly, the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt. then, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw, aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed ""should"" be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister's ""turf"" - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that, unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry, it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.","it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.the prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign.and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it -

an issue many hoped and believed was above such things.either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue.",neutral,0.9241647124290466

business,"oil prices reach three-month low oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that us crude stocks have improved ahead of winter. london brent crude closed at 40.15 on thursday - a drop of 5.1 - having dived below 40 a barrel for the first time since mid-september. us light crude traded in new york lost more than 2 to 43.25, its lowest close since 10 september. the price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12 in two days. the falls were triggered when the energy information administration (eia) said on wednesday that us crude stocks were 3.5 higher than a year ago. the news calmed worries about winter shortages. weak us fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. ""it's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,"" said rick mueller, an analyst at energy security analysis. analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil. the stronger fuel inventories helped boost us stock markets to nine-month highs on wednesday, though only the nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of thursday. in london, the ftse 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. the long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. however, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in north america this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world. the price of crude is still up about 30 on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of 55.67 set in late october. opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild us stocks hit by supply disruptions after hurricane ivan in september. traders were also encouraged by comments on wednesday from the energy minister of opec member algeria. chakib khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. however, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. fears still remain over the level of us heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. a cold spell in north america would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. ""mother nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,"" said kyle cooper, at citigroup global markets.

business,"battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy. the greenback hit 1.3516 in thin new york trade, before rallying to 1.3509. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about 1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits. meanwhile, france's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls. herve gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of g7 countries in february. ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. ""it's absolutely essential that at the meeting of the g7 our american friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level,"" said mr gaymard. thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12 in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity. commerce department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the us economy - grew just 0.2 last month. the figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8 rise in october. the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters. the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002. the us says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly. statements from president bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin us deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. but while some observers said the quiet trade on thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market, most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. ""i can see it finishing the year around 1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro dollar in 2005, finishing the year around 1.40,"" said adrian hughes, currency strategist with hsbc in london.","the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy.thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12 in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about 1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits.meanwhile, france's finance minister has said the world faced ""economic catastrophe"" unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls.the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from ""abnormal and dangerous heights"" set in 2002.ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies.",negative,0.9983396530151367
tech,"tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks. the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. in the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone. ""if you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,"" he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. ""what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said mr flynn. ""people did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,"" he added. the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk's phone firms. ""everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,"" said andrew bud, regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox. ""it's all about transparency,"" he said. ""consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it."" ""the consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said. christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,"" he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said mr flynn. also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. ""we have quite draconian contracts with firms,"" he said. ""we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off."" under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.

politics,"new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra's ""lackadaisical"" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak. public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. but mr leigh said the department was ""dragging its heels"". that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. he also said defra had been ""dreadfully slow"" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis. the outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the uk up to 8bn. ""four years after the outbreak, defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and 40m of invoices remain unpaid,"" mr leigh said. mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis. ministers had hoped to get 900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted 349m. that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between ""two and three times"" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. on the issue of the unpaid invoices, sir john said defra had paid 97 of the 1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, ""but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations"". mr leigh said being ""better prepared"" would also help avoid the need for ""mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak"". a defra spokesman said: ""we welcome the report. it acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak.

tech,"finding new homes for old phones re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too. research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites. the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk. of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25 get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. the slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates james goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future. ""it's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,"" said mr goodman. many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said mr goodman. far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. ""we've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,"" said mr goodman, ""but there's a strong social argument too."" older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. ""it's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network,"" said mr goodman, ""and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones."" but the relatively low wages in romania, which is one of the poorest countries in europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. ""the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,"" he said. reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. georgeta minciu, a romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me."" ""this is the only way i can afford to have a phone,"" she said. mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain's mobile mountain made it overseas. but, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. ""if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,"" he said.","mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain's mobile mountain made it overseas.""this is the only way i can afford to have a phone,"" she said.older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model.re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets.""it's quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,"" said mr goodman.research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide.georgeta minciu, a romanian part-time cleaner, said: ""normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages.the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk.",positive,0.9993639588356018

just over the road from their modern day home. just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at 5. the first film to win was wings, which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner. the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman's chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday, then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953, with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar? there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar. one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article. the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn's first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2,530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort, the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement? the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5,700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy, receipt of an academy award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics. among the overlooked films were hobson's choice, dirty harry, the 39 steps, the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927), humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944), gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq, but as it didn't stop during world war ii or the vietnam war. documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars, including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was ""demeaning"". writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers' guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood's apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz. the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared ""come on up and get it, frank"" to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade. capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.","the first film to win was wings, which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award.the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines.writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers' guild was striking at the time.the first televised ceremony was in 1953, with bob hope as the mc.opal was murdered in 1979.the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn's first best actress win in 1934.in support of the war effort, the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii.for the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results.douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards.how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel -

""this is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau,"" said marco behrmann, director of community relations at mindark, the game's developer. the virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. he has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes. ""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier. the entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into ped (project entropia dollars) and back again into real money. ten peds are the equivalent to one us dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ( 5) and shogun armour ( 1.70) gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating peds through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the entropia universe. mmorpgs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. almost 200,000 people are registered players on project entropia.","the land exists within the game project entropia, an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other.entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares.deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold.the australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker deathifier, bought the island in an online auction.""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier.a 22-year-old gamer has spent 26,500 ( 13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg).",positive,0.9958536624908447

tech,"tech helps disabled speed demons an organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations. the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham's nec, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display. motorcycle racer, roy tansley, from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. ""i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg,"" mr tansley told the bbc news website. ""in simple terms, i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device."" mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing's governing body, the autocycle union. ""at that time they wouldn't let any amputee race at all, but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars."" mr tansley's invention, the pro-shift, is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. in addition to helping disabled riders to compete, mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt. as a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. ""i'm not prejudiced, i'll sell to able-bodied people if i have to!"" he joked. another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. the vehicle belongs to pararallying, the world's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire. ""we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company,"" said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company. ""the cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we've yet to turn anybody away."" mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas. the car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar. when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, murray, is a former australian formula 3 champion. and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals, a cushion behind her back and raising the seat.

business,"putin backs state grab for yukos russia's president has defended the purchase of yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm rosneft, saying it followed free market principles. vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. rosneft bought 100 of baikal finance group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russia's booming oil industry. rosneft will now control about 16 of russia's total crude oil output. yukos share jumped in moscow, climbing as much as 50 before being suspended. rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, a move that will see gazprom return to majority state-ownership. baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos's main production division at a forced auction on sunday. ""everything was done by market methods,"" mr putin said at his year-end press conference in moscow. shedding some light on the kremlin's motivation, mr putin referred to a period of so-called ""cowboy capitalism"" that followed the collapse of the soviet union. he said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery, including law breaking, by people seeking to acquire valuable state property. ""now the state, using market methods, is safeguarding its interests. i think this is quite normal,"" the russian president said. a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a ""balanced, national energy corporation."" the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos, one of russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse. the russian government put yukos's yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a 27bn ( 14bn) bill for back taxes and fines. analysts say that yukos's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week's cloak-and-dagger dealings. gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction. by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft, russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said. ""you cannot sue the russian government,"" said eric kraus, a strategist at moscow's sovlink securities. ""the russian government has sovereign immunity.""

tech,"creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin, head of the team behind the first macintosh computer, has died. mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released. he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. the 1984 release of the mac reflected mr raskin's belief that good design should make computers easy to use. mr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department. however, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. the result was the 1984 macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing, clicking and dragging. although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh. the gui was developed by xerox parc, and used in its star machine. but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer. ""his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him,"" said andy hertzfeld, an early macintosh team member. although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released. in 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with apple's mercurial boss steve jobs. in 1982, mr raskin left apple entirely. the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. after leaving apple, mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. he was also an accomplished musician, played three instruments and conducted san francisco's chamber opera society. mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california.","mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released.the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company.however, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released.but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer.in 1982, mr raskin left apple entirely.mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california.jef raskin, head of the team behind the first macintosh computer, has died.",neutral,0.9997749924659729

sport,"dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career. even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue, just four days before the start of the season. but then dallaglio has always been his own man. ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions. to supporters of england, dallaglio could do no wrong. an integral part of a sustained period of success for england, dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003. rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. never afraid to speak his mind, be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch, or his coach or the media off it, dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993. it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv, but once there he proved to the manor born. displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard. within two years of his debut, dallaglio was offered the england captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa. although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson, he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, dallaglio's career hit the buffers at speed in 1999. first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio's decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy. with sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages, a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper. but he bounced back, getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold, albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson. as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned - dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again. yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio's involvement on the lions tour to australia. rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace, but ever the pragmatist, he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre. the only player to play every minute of england's world cup triumph in australia, dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. following johnson's retirement, dallaglio's career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-world cup tests, dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england's most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country. the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. the likes of matt dawson, jonny wilkinson, phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio's role as captain. but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio's massive influence on english rugby.","to supporters of england, dallaglio could do no wrong.dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993.while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-world cup tests, dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations.following johnson's retirement, dallaglio's career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain.an integral part of a sustained period of success for england, dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003.within two years of his debut, dallaglio was offered the england captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa.the only player to play every minute of england's world cup triumph in australia, dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters.as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory -

business,"iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters. a vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. ""first rule of law, then the economy,"" says radwan hadi, deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services, which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday's election, according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq. job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people's wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. ""estimates of iraq's unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40 ,"" the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded 22bn since june 2003. iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad's pharmacies. observes mr hadi: ""the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq, the jordanian investment bank export finance bank has bought 49 of national bank of iraq. foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes ms alexander. ""it is seen as a selling off of iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers,"" she says. consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100 foreign ownership of iraqi assets, she explains. in the west, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that ""people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things"", ms alexander says. yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists mr hadi, an iraqi who left the country three decades ago. ""i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" mr hadi says. ""iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."" many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi's blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch's baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, mr hadi points out.

""the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,"" said carlos saldarriaga, technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes. one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system, with its flagship huaral.org website. there, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. ""water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,"" mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world. cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. ""throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,"" said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""we have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" so far, the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in peru. ""this is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,"" underlined mr saldarriaga. the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights.

tech,"speech takes on search engines a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results. called speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results. scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november. but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments. the edinburgh-based firm cec has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web. according to search engine ask jeeves, around 80 of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters. ""it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad,"" said speegle founder gordon renton. ""the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. ""we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the royal national institute of the blind (rnib) is looking at the technology,"" he added. but julie howell, digital policy manager at the rnib, expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web. ""there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be,"" she said. ""blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way,"" she added. the site uses a technology dubbed panavox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine google. google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said mr renton. ""it is not a rip-off. we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"" he said. speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china. ""the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots,"" said mr renton.","called speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results.a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.the edinburgh-based firm cec has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search.visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine google.google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said mr renton.but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november.""we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the royal national institute of the blind (rnib) is looking at the technology,"" he added.according to search engine ask jeeves, around 80 of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net.but julie howell, digital policy manager at the rnib, expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web.",neutral,0.9995548129081726

sport,"faultless federer has no equal roger federer - nice bloke, fantastic tennis player - the ultimate sportsman. when lleyton hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing, a third in as many months, the australian said; ""you're the best."" how right he is. the stats speak for themselves: 11 titles from 11 finals during 2004 - three of them grand slams - and 13 final victories in a row going back to vienna 2003. that's an open-era record. hewitt, at times in houston, showed form which easily matched his grand slam-winning efforts of 2001 and 2002. but he was outplayed. twice. hewitt, along with andy roddick and marat safin, is sure to be prominent during 2005. but realistically, all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. according to all those players and even federer himself, the swiss star is in a different league.

tech,"be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson. if it gets its way, the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention? yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas. in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you, because they hold the patent on ""one-click"" online purchase. it is a small invention, but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it. we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the council of ministers, radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany's main political parties have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned. the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an ""a"" item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried? first, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow? more directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent. this is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. i have never, to my shame, managed to read lord byron's childe harold's pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files, then i am in trouble under patent law, at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders. even this system breaks down, of course, as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe's computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.","this goes to the heart of the

entertainment,"oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema. if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore's bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9 11 and mel gibson's the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9 11 breaking us box office records for a documentary, and the passion of the christ making more than us 370m ( 196m) in the us alone. but this year's academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score. fahrenheit 9 11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the palme d'or at the cannes international film festival in 2004. moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says tim dams, the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore's film does not sit well with the academy. ""if you look at past oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9 11 didn't really fit in to that category. ""they tend to go for films like titanic, gladiator, and the lord of the rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not ""snubbing"" moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. ""i think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,"" he said. the problem with mel gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic, an ancient middle eastern language. ""hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said. but aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. but mr dams said: ""it's not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany, and it's a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster."" another 'contentious' film, mr dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm. independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress. the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said: ""it's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced.

""it doesn't matter if it's 30m, 40m or 50m, we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will."" on the subject of liverpool's finances, parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard. on the subject of liverpool's captain and prize asset, parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said: ""they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes, but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale."" but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season, parry said: ""i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa's views. ""we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that. ""i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. ""we all want to see progress by next season. he's not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim."" it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. ""there have been a lot of open secrets about steven, most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn't had an offer last summer,"" parry explained. ""we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. in reality it didn't go beyond that. ""maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won't. ""our position is we want steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. ""you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. you can forget that."" parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool's new stadium in stanley park, which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenal's 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said: ""i have to say historically it is something i have been against, and i have been on record as saying that, but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener. ""i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. ""but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' ""my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium."" some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered: ""i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. ""if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? time will tell. ""i think the stadium will always be anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? i think it would be remiss not to. ""that's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but i think it is clearly something we have to explore."" on the subject of possible new investment, parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as ""a stalking horse"" to attract other bids, but parry explained: ""steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there's no need, and that is not the way we do business. ""we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. ""quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december, and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it.

tech,"more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2 each year between 2002 and 2004. the study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. it is thought that 40 of those buying home net security programs are retired. for the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2 . but more retired women (53 ) were buying security software than retired men. the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers. the study predicts that 40 of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005. they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007, if current rates persist, according to the research. ""i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong"", said one over-60 woman who took part in the research. ""you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years,"" paul goosens, head of preventon told the bbc news website. ""now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home."" but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said. programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too, said mr goosens. security software should be easy to use, with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language, he added. the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. high-profile complaints about rogue diallers, and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers, have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus, firewall and spyware-removal programs too. without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally. more than 30,000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from symantec showed last year. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs, many based in eastern europe, over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said mr goosens, they are reported in the press much more. ""you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. they are asking the right questions,"" he explained. ""it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider, that they are safe to connect to the net."" an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30 of uk homes will have broadband net access. in july last year, the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the office of national statistics.","it is thought that 40 of those buying home net security programs are retired.the study predicts that 40 of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005.older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study.the study, for net security firm preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers.but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30 of uk homes will have broadband net access.the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said mr goosens, they are reported in the press much more.viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts.but more retired women (53 ) were buying security software than retired men.in july last year, the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the office of national statistics.the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2 each year between 2002 and 2004.more than 30,000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from symantec showed last year.",positive,0.9995104074478149

tech,"bad e-mail habits sustains spam the 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found. according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts. the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. ""this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,"" said marcel nienhuis, market analyst at the radicati group.

tech,"kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus. they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates. ""the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals."" the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates. ""it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc."" the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. ""it's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult."" the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system. ""the content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other."" eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries.

""there is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work,"" said home office minister hazel blears.

tech,"smart search lets art fans browse if you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. artgarden, developed by bt's research unit, is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures. clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works. the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. it 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. so, for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. ""it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery,"" said jemima rellie, head of the tate's digital programme. for richard tateson, who worked on the artgarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration.

business,"turkey knocks six zeros off lira turkey is to relaunch its currency on saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy. the change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth 15. these valuations were the product of decades of inflation which, as recently as 2001, was as high as 70 . inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving. the currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 january. from that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. the government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the european union. on an everyday level, it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and turks alike. ""the transition to the new turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years,"" said sureyya serdengecti, head of the turkish central bank. ""the new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years."" the turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. turkey had to turn to the international monetary fund for financial assistance, accepting a 18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. these tough measures have borne fruit. inflation fell below 10 earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30 this year. meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9 growth expected in 2004. the government hopes that the new currency will cement the country's economic progress, two weeks after eu leaders set a date for the start of turkey's accession talks. the slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.

""mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said thomas husson, mobile analyst at jupiter research. ""mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches."" other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of apple's itunes, napster and other net music download services. with phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us, services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but, the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently, tv-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several european operators, like italy's tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe, trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology, one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004, the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens, said gartner. digital video recorders, like europe's sky box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii, nokia 6600, sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44 over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.","the service uses 3gp technology, one of the standards for mobile tv.a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day.""mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,"" said thomas husson, mobile analyst at jupiter research.a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is ""unlikely"" in europe until 2007.mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report.despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said jupiter.various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally.but, the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait.but at the end of 2004, the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe.digital video recorders, like europe's sky box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch.in the us, services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones.people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens, said gartner.tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts.",negative,0.5039268732070923

""in a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,"" he said. part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. halo, the sims, driver, need for speed, fifa football, burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. despite this fondness for older games, doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. games linked to shrek, the incredibles, spider-man, harry potter and lord of the rings were all in the top 20. elspa noted that sales of xbox games rose 37.9 during the year. however, sony's playstation 2 was the top seller with 47 of the 1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. despite winning awards and rave reviews half-life 2 did not appear in the list. this was because it was only released on pc and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. also the novel distribution system adopted by developer valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.","however, sony's playstation 2 was the top seller with 47 of the 1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console.electronic arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.the game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale.elspa noted that sales of xbox games rose 37.9 during the year.valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.although only released in november the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies.this feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the uk.there were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies.""in a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,"" he said.",positive,0.9996565580368042
business,"nigeria to boost cocoa production the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme. agriculture minister adamu bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. the government will pump 154m naira ( 1.1m; 591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer. cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s. but with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. at the launch of the programme in the south-western city of ibadan, mr bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. he also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. the country could be looking to emulate rival ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. however, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. ""people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,"" said joshua osagie, a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters. ""the farmers in the village never see any assistance,"" he added. at the same time as nigeria announced its new initiative, ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records. the country saw more than 1.2bn-worth of the beans exported during 2003-04. analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.","the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.analysts said high tech-production techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower.""people who are not farming will hijack the subsidy,"" said joshua osagie, a cocoa farmer from edo state told reuters.nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s.but with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970.",positive,0.9995606541633606

""like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,"" said project manager caroline pelletier. ""games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,"" she said. the researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. ""without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be, they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity,"" said research fellow diane carr. the second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. sixth-form teacher barney oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, tv and popular music at the a-level course he runs at long road sixth form college in cambridge. for parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy. dr andrew burn, associate director of the institute of education's centre for the study of children, youth and media moved to reassure anxious parents. ""games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do,"" he said. ""but we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games."" the games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children.

""i guess it's just a television show but we always think it's a bit more.' the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show. as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house. ""it's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. but you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting,"" explains conti. and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed.

business,"millions 'to lose textile jobs' millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned. the world trade organisation (wto) is to end its multi-fibre agreement (mfa) on midnight of 31 december. christian aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in bangladesh alone being axed. however, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for western consumers. it will also see more jobs created in india and china, advocates argue. the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. ""there will be a period of adjustment required,"" said wto spokesman keith rockwell. ""some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. ""some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships."" christian aid has called on british firms not to simply ""cut and run"" but look after their workers, in a new report called rags to riches to rags. it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. the wto itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost 85 of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. ""the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh, cambodia, sri lanka and nepal,"" andrew pendleton, christian aid's head of trade policy, said. ""they will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. ""we are deeply concerned that the new year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers."" the wto said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market. it added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should ""put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost"". while the current mfa was not perfect, its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, christian aid said.

politics,"mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change. the cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70 of members would be elected. mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. the group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. tony blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto. but the all-party group, including tories ken clarke and sir george young, labour's robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a ""large majority"". and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans. the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largely-elected second chamber. their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament, and its members would be known as mscps. there would be 385 mscps, including 270 elected members, 87 appointed members and 16 bishops. they would serve for between 12 and 14 years. mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. he added: ""over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. ""what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament?"" the group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable. it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a ""largely democratic"" second chamber in their manifestos. mr clarke said the issue ""went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system"". and mr tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed.

business,"booming markets shed few tears the market, former british government minister michael heseltine once said, has no morality. and indeed, stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster. stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all-time highs this week; even in sri lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5 since the waves hit. bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. the msci world share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the bbc global 30 has risen by 3 in the past week. and this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts. in fact, the markets are being perfectly rational. for a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from india, only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance, and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. and where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally. second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil, technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. those that are listed have suffered: confifi hotel holdings, a small sri lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. but there are winners as well as losers. asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. in indonesia, shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week. more broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact. according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university, there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. a study of the 1993 des moines floods, from the disaster research center at the university of delaware , found that 70 of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18 felt themselves better off. ""although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard-hit, do indeed recover,"" the authors concluded. but disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors. in particular, many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system, as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. in fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently 30 trillion and rising. a series of recent shocks, the colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. the trillion-dollar debts of japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo. and the us stock market was on its way down long before 11 september, 2001; it rose by 20 during the six months following the attacks.

""it was serendipity really - i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features, who had distributed monsoon wedding,"" nair told bbc world service's masterpiece programme.

""as i got older and read it, i think it was thackeray's clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider.

tech,"what price for 'trusted pc security'? you can now buy ""trusted computers"", but can we really trust the pc vendors, asks technology analyst bill thompson. if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer, a dell optiplex, or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba, hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (tpm) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children's toys. but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. and as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based. at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. it might be password-protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor. hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer. this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers. as a result we settle for second best. so when it comes to computer security, trusted systems could be a major step forward. after all, if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. instead you have to use special software, like hp's protecttools or wave systems' embassy. this provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks. full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows, ""longhorn"". this will include what microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the ""next generation secure computing base"", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses, spyware and data theft that this will provide. because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (drm) systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them. we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. users of apple's itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users, a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection. but the latest version of itunes limits this capability, just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd. another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real's harmony service on your ipod. apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. similarly, users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows, and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it. one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. once it is unlocked then someone, somewhere, will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us, most of the time, will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends, record shows i want to watch later, and burn cds for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today. bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.","because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights

is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law.when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall.this will include what microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the ""next generation secure computing base"", and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware.what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform.inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (tpm) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features.at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems.eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children's toys.and as part of a well-designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today.hardware security is less common, even if it is a lot safer.but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them.full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows, ""longhorn"".this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software, and the users cannot control it.apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management.one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away.",neutral,0.9928160905838013

tech,"peer-to-peer nets 'here to stay' peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts. once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology. the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon, according to the panel. the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content, said travis kalanick, founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with ""business models"" that work for them, which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards. but, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with p2p cannot not happen, said michael weiss, president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out, mr weiss said: ""old media always tries to stop new media. ""when they can't stop it, they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money."" once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004, the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast, two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle, and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal. p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services, like apple itunes, napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months, the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks, not least because of the financial aspect. there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. ""we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p,"" said marc morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer. ""consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together,"" agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands, for example, use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. ""increasingly, what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content,"" said derek broes, from microsoft. ""they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread,"" he said. looking into p2p's future, file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks, as far as mr broes is concerned. ""once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,"" he said. ""file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.""","but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content, said travis kalanick, founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology.the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them.""we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p,"" said marc morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.but, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with p2p cannot not happen, said michael weiss, president of streamcast networks.""increasingly, what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content,"" said derek broes, from microsoft.p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january.but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.looking into p2p's future, file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks, as far as mr broes is concerned.but such download services are very different from p2p networks, not least because of the financial aspect.""they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread,"" he said.peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.unsigned bands, for example, use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.",neutral,0.7701132297515869

business,"bush budget seeks deep cutbacks president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at 427bn ( 230bn) this year. the 2.58 trillion ( 1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by 10 , with more money to treat hiv aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by 4.8 , to reach 419.3bn. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year. congress will spend several months debating george w bush's proposal. the state department's planned budget would rise to just under 23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost 6bn to assist us allies in the ""war on terror"". however, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv aids, the bbc's jonathan beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to 3bn, with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush's proposed spending of 3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of 5bn. a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income. some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to 4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases. the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6 at agriculture and 5.6 at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1 to 2.18 trillion. spending is forecast to grow by 3.5 to 2.57 trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency.

""we were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. ""at that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the napster time, when p2p services became popular.

business,"bank opts to leave rates on hold the bank of england has left interest rates on hold at 4.75 for a sixth month in a row. the bank's monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. interest rates rose five times between november 2003 and august 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. economists see next week's inflation report from the mpc as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check. slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6 in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts. and recent house surveys from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw, chief economist at investec securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75 for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.

tech,"what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video, then it was the dvd, and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition. high-definition gives incredible, 3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so, and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds, it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean, director of business development for digital content company thx, a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy, finding nemo, the incredibles and indiana jones. ""there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds,"" he told the bbc news website. ""the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined. ""the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,"" he says. but currently, putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand. ""as much as you compress the picture data rate wise, you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master,"" he explains. ""i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting."" high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months' time. mr dean is confident though: ""i think if they see real hd high-definition , not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference. ""i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen."" high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole, producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally, it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd. ""when we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,"" says mr dean. ""our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second. ""that's a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98 . so if you have anything that allows more space, you don't have to compress so hard."" studios could fit a lot more marketing material, games, and features, onto high-capacity dvds. currently, an entire dvd project can take up to three months, says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed, this will realistically only save a day's work, says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks, making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay. ""if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks, it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required."" and if studios do focus on delivering more ""added value content"", thinks mr dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price, studios will listen, thinks mr dean. high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous. ""when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i, everybody was very sun-tanned, but that was make-up. ""in the hd version of episode i, all these make-up lines showed up,"" explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too. ""there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots, there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways. ""you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn't see it."" what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas, this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films, and in what format, will widen. ""in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol - broadband , giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive,"" says mr dean. but that is some time off for most, and for now, people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.","but currently, putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.currently, an entire dvd project can take up to three months, says mr dean.but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds, it will profoundly change home entertainment.those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd.first it was the humble home video, then it was the dvd, and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.and if studios do focus on delivering more ""added value content"", thinks mr dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it.high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike.it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months' time.high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to.mr dean is confident though: ""i think if they see real hd high-definition , not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference.high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too.on the whole, producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed.equally, it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.""in the hd version of episode i, all these make-up lines showed up,"" explains mr dean.""when we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,"" says mr dean.""the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,"" he says.if studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay.",positive,0.977454662322998
business,"bank holds interest rate at 4.75 the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75 , in a widely-predicted move. rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence. rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain's retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade. ""today's no change decision is correct,"" said david frost, director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc). ""but, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates.

""it is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably."" cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had ""slowed in recent months in response to rate rises"" but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. ""the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said. ""interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time."" on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1 in november, matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3 rise. manufacturers' organisation, the eef, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain. ""so far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said eef chief economist, steve radley. ""however, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the bank should stand ready to cut rates."" some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5 before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15 a year - if economic conditions worsen.","cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had ""slowed in recent months in response to rate rises"" but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.manufacturers' organisation, the eef, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future.""the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said.the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75 , in a widely-predicted move.""so far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said eef chief economist, steve radley.it also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august.rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium.""interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.""",negative,0.9983300566673279

tech,"gadget market 'to grow in 2005' the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in las vegas, have been told. the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11 , while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. ""everything is going digital,"" kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association, told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005's products. ""consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs high-definition tvs , digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. ""all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry."" despite showing diversity, some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much ""wow factor"" as in previous years. the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces, which was the ""time and place shifting"" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time. at the start of last year's ces, the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4 in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice, with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the ""generation x-ers"" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57 of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to cea research. hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor. ""a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it,"" said stephen baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group. ""some of these functions cost next to nothing to add."" as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony's new portable games device, the psp, had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their ""consumer technology"" offering. elsewhere at the show, there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens, including samsung's 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like seagate's 5gb pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120,000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas, which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.","the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in las vegas, have been told.the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005's products.the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces, which was the ""time and place shifting"" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time.another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony's new portable games device, the psp, had at the show.a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their ""consumer technology"" offering.he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices.""everything is going digital,"" kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association, told the bbc news website.hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor.as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as microsoft chief bill gates.""all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.""that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras.more than 57 of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to cea research.",positive,0.9995437264442444
tech,"no half measures with half-life 2 could half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype? after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time. fortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be. you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you. whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie. considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components, this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500 processor and ati's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow. virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms, hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii, it's all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside. the game does have a couple of problems. firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people. a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future. half-life 2 is out now for the pc","at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.the game does have a couple of problems.whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.could half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype?it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here.the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life.considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications.it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances -

business,"uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez's agrarian reform programme. officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure. the firm, whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm. officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. ""the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,"" state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters. ""as a consequence the government has taken action."" controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century. critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added: ""agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land."" the company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the venezuelan market. last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had ""nothing to fear"". under president chavez, the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.","the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities.officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers.venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez's agrarian reform programme.last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000.the firm, whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law.under president chavez, the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy.the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had ""nothing to fear"".the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.",neutral,0.9979384541511536
tech,"'no re-draft' for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps. the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms. the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"". the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, ""computer implemented invention"". in a letter, ec president jos 233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament, josep borrell, that the commission ""did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)"" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004. if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament's request it would be an ""insult"" to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service, for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.","a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive.the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review ""all aspects of the directive"".supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament.most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law.",negative,0.9602201581001282

politics,"faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog. independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief, david bell, for not doing enough to promote the ""wider tenets of british society"". mr bell said muslim, jewish and evangelical christian schools must be ""intolerant of intolerance"". diversity ""certainly must not mean segregated or separate"", he said. mr bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more. badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell, and in a speech to the hansard society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 muslim, 100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools. mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a ""common heritage"" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. ""i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society,"" said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools. ""many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony."" mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were ""tricky issues"". but he argued that ""we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation"". ""i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,"" said mr bell.","mr bell said muslim, jewish and evangelical christian schools must be ""intolerant of intolerance"".""i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society,"" said mr bell.he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 muslim, 100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools.mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were ""tricky issues"".mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a ""common heritage"" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief, david bell, for not doing enough to promote the ""wider tenets of british society"".",negative,0.9966044425964355
sport,"ireland 17-12 south africa ronan o'gara scored all ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road. o'gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o'gara penalties extended ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans, ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on, denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss. ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland's first points - o'gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o'gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score, the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however, the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland's lead to 5-3. ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure, the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o'gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o'gara penalty. however, montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland's lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o'gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty. in the 61st minute, hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however, a late tackle on brian o'driscoll enabled o'gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland's lead to 17-6. however, two montgomery penalties had ireland's lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory. g dempsey;

politics,"what the election should really be about? a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll. we've called for the state pension to be increased from 79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of 105.45. that's what we're calling for. many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. if we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty. we've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. they will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. it's our way of putting the politicians on notice. we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative. in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour. but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around. they cannot take that vote for granted. pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner's full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world. that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment. we haven't worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps. various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. we don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out. it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq. repealing the hunting bill. we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action. we are hoping to hear in the new year. whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid. so there's a lot of legal territory to go. we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affairs minister) alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. it is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything. it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face. it's exactly what the prime minister did not want. he wanted the issue off the table until after the election. people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. it is another sort of form of shooting for sport. the principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant. we will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it. i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilise public opinion. everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban. the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. it's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. we want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice. firstly, we have our website. it features our campaigns and changes every day. secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. we will invite the opinion formers, mps, journalists and others. the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians. i think we will be successful. it's very much the language being used by the main political parties. politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue. fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. we have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about 750. if you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that. if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business. we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. whatever we do, the public don't like lorries -

sport,"chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1) john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez's header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too, after mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. riise could not have connected any better with morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal, the quickest-ever in a league cup final, stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues' attacking chances were limited, and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard's powerfully-struck drive and drogba's low shot. despite their frustration, chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool's well-organised defence. joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore, but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless, liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from gudjohnsen's header, then to smother william gallas' follow-up. and despite chelsea's possession, it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman's feet, while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval, drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from glen johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite liverpool's desperate attacks, chelsea clung on to win. dudek, finnan, carragher, hyypia, traore (biscan 67), luis garcia, gerrard, hamann, riise, kewell (nunez 56), morientes (baros 74). subs not used: pellegrino, carson. hyypia, traore, hamann, carragher. riise 1, nunez 113. cech, paulo ferreira, ricardo carvalho, terry, gallas (kezman 74), jarosik (gudjohnsen 45), lampard, makelele, cole (johnson 81), drogba, duff. subs not used: pidgeley, tiago. lampard, kezman, drogba, duff. gerrard 79 og, drogba 107, kezman 112. 78,000 s bennett (kent).","there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite liverpool's desperate attacks, chelsea clung on to win.dudek, finnan, carragher, hyypia, traore (biscan 67), luis garcia, gerrard, hamann, riise, kewell (nunez 56), morientes (baros 74).and the blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle.blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game.gerrard 79 og, drogba 107, kezman 112.lampard, kezman, drogba, duff.and despite chelsea's possession, it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech.that prompted mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining.but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later -

politics,"'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. if there was to be a cap, it should be 10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons, european parliament, scottish parliament, welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: ""there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.

business,"business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business. lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend. but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce, which stands beside the opera house, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern english towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? like northern england and industrial scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. beck-crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres, about 20 miles from lille. the company has not laid off a worker since 1945. it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in europe these days. director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in china and india. ""in our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged european union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,"" he says. it isn't just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. but at least there is still a steel industry. coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. new business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference. that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu, says frederic sawicki, a politics lecturer at the university of lille. ""in the region today the unemployment rate is 12 , in some areas it is 15 . they don't see what europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" he says. which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. much of that trade passes through the world's largest port, rotterdam, in holland, home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec. its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed, but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer. boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home. ""in the us growth is something like 6 , in china they are estimating 15 , and in the eu it is more or less 1 ,"" he says. mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand. he much preferred the old currencies of europe, which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. in germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2 . in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years. with germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. if germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. however, at one factory near the dutch border things are changing. the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary. factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity ""by nearly 30 "". but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china. the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says helmut schneider, director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university. ""labour is too costly in germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,"" he says. the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.","in germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment.but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china.boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home.if germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be.""in the us growth is something like 6 , in china they are estimating 15 , and in the eu it is more or less 1 ,"" he says.which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here.it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in europe these days.as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.they don't see what europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,"" he says.""labour is too costly in germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu, says frederic sawicki, a politics lecturer at the university of lille.the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world.with germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem.director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in china and india.new business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years.",negative,0.9900943636894226
tech,"'friends fear' with lost mobiles people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends. more than 50 of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. more than half (54 ) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book. a fifth rely entirely on mobiles. about 80 of uk adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures. it is estimated that 53 of over 65s own a mobile, according to intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. most 15 to 24-year-olds (94 ), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92 ), own at least one. nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced. the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead. ""we're a nation of lazy so-and-sos,"" david noone from intervoice said. ""we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can't be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. ""the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart."" one in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. most (62 ) said they had no idea what their partner's number was. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. generally, information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds. but some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. for non-smartphone users, a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. o2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over gprs and gsm. neither vodafone or t-mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use sim back-up devices. it is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50 of total street crime involves a mobile. mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26 more than the previous year, according to analysts. it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.","people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.more than 50 of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years.mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead.""the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart.""nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts' information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced.mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year.it is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50 of total street crime involves a mobile.many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem.globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26 more than the previous year, according to analysts.more than half (54 ) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book.the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book.",negative,0.8578379154205322
